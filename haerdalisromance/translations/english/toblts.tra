@2    = ~You look worried. What's on your mind?~
@3    = ~Ah, I was wondering when you'd start having second thoughts about us.~
@4    = ~Make it quick, bard.~
@5    = ~I need to talk to you, too.~
@6    = ~I always make time for you, Haer'Dalis.~
@7    = ~Ah, I was wondering when you'd start regreting your little 'speech.'~
@8    = ~And that is but one of the many things I appreciate about you, fair <CHARNAME>.~
@9    = ~Worried, is it? No, 'tis not worry I feel, not truly. Something akin to it perhaps.~
@10   = ~Why would you think such a thing? Do you truly believe me the sort to carelessly toss words of devotion and affection?~
@11   = ~Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't mean it like that.~
@12   = ~I was joking, my sparrow.~
@13   = ~Just hurry up and say whatever it is you need to say.~
@14   = ~I believe you're the sort to do all kinds of things, *actor*.~
@15   = ~No, you owe me no apology. 'Tis likely I deserve your suspicions.~
@16   = ~Glad am I to hear that! For a moment, I feared you were misplacing your own doubts into the mind of this poor sparrow.~
@17   = ~Why then would you accept and return my declaration of love if you did not believe it to be truth?~
@18   = ~Oh, I'm saying this all wrong! I'm sorry, I *do* love you!~
@19   = ~Haer'Dalis, I'm teasing you!~
@20   = ~Because even the illusion of love carries some comfort.~
@21   = ~You didn't exactly give me much choice! I felt trapped and said the first thing I could think to shut you up!~

@23   = ~Surely you don't believe you're the only one capable of manipulation.~
@24   = ~My raven, my love, I know not what I can say to convince you that you have my heart in your hands. This bard can only hope you someday realize it.~

@42   = ~Oh? What would you have of me?~
@43   = ~You go first.~

@47   = ~I think I've made a terrible mistake.~

@55   = ~I... Did you now?~
@56   = ~The way I approached you as we chased your soul into the depths of Hell... My raven, 'twas most unfair of me. Truthfully, I believed that the end had come for us both and wished only to say what I'd felt in my heart for some time.~

@60   = ~It was a bit dramatic, even for you.~
@61   = ~Irenicus had more time to prepare thanks to your foolish interruption.~
@62   = ~Ah, my darling, how delightful a thing to know this Bhaalspawn that stands before me is a gentle romantic at heart!~
@63   = ~Aye, that is not far from the truth, and glad I am for that.~
@64   = ~Oh, most assuredly. After your mage-thief was slain, I saw you fall and felt my soul dragged from my body into deepest darkness. Even after we woke and the pieces of that puzzle began to form a way of escape, I was convinced our journey had ended.~
@65   = ~I'm so sorry I dragged you through all that.~
@66   = ~If you hadn't been at my side, I don't think I could have managed to keep moving forward.~
@67   = ~To be honest, it wasn't exactly my brightest moment of hope either. I'm just glad to be done with it.~
@68   = ~You underestimated me.~
@69   = ~No, you should not be. After all, I am not sorry, and it 'twas I who was being dragged. 'Twas curious and fascinating! And I was glad to be at your side, of course.~
@70   = ~You are stronger than you believe, my <CHARNAME>, but if there is ever a moment when you need to fall, I will be glad if I am there to hold you up.~
@71   = ~Aye, that is a sentiment worthy of an entire bottle of the finest wine! Perhaps two.~
@72   = ~Perhaps I did at that. It would hardly be the first time, and likely not the last, as you seem quite talented at shattering all my perceptions into tiny fragments of doubt.~
@73   = ~Hah! I would like to think it was a perfectly appropriate amount of drama. Regardless, it was poor timing and poor taste for this humble bard to have laid himself bare in that moment.~
@74   = ~Aye, that is something I myself have thought and is part of the reason that I now stand humbly before you, seeking your forgiveness.~
@75   = ~Oh, never mind that. It was a terribly romantic thing you did.~
@76   = ~(sigh) I dragged you into that mess. If anyone should be sorry, it should be me.~
@77   = ~If you ever get in my way again, Haer'Dalis, not even our love will stop my wrath.~
@78   = ~Aye, understood. I am glad to be at your side, my fierce hound, and not facing you on the battlefield.~
@79   = ~As we move toward greater adventure still, 'tis my fondest hope that what we share will not soon fall to entropy's whims.~
@80   = ~My sweet bard, I have faith that it will never fade.~
@81   = ~But you believe it will fade, don't you? That it *must* fade?~
@82   = ~(groan) Can't you just go a few moments without blathering on about decay and death?~
@83   = ~Whatever time we have together, I'm grateful for it. Let's not waste what we have on worry about when it will end.~
@84   = ~That sounded like a subtle hint that I should prepare for you to abandon me someday.~
@85   = ~Eh, I'm sure I'll grow bored with you soon enough.~
@86   = ~Do you? Surely you realize that is a futile faith. There is no place we can hide from the inevitable.~
@87   = ~It doesn't matter if you believe me. I have faith enough for us both.~
@88   = ~If it's so inevitable, why love at all?~
@89   = ~Oh, just shut up and let me enjoy the moment for once!~
@90   = ~You amaze me. Though I know I should scorn such foolish hope, I cannot help but cherish this look you give me now. Truly, my heart is yours.~
@91   = ~A life without love would be a tragedy indeed, my darling. I do not ask that you agree with me, but do not doubt that my love for you is genuine.~
@92   = ~Hah! As you command, my fiery love.~
@93   = ~'Tis not a matter of belief, my dear, but of truth. Surely by now you know what I will say on this particular subject, aye?~
@94   = ~Yes, I do, and I've no desire to hear more of you blathering on about decay and death.~
@95   = ~Only too well...~
@96   = ~<CHARNAME>, that is entirely unfair. I do *not* blather.~
@97   = ~My delightful darling...~
@98   = ~(He lifts his hand to your face and traces the slope of your cheek with his gloved fingers before he leans in to catch your lips in a tender, lingering kiss.)~
@99   = ~Truly, you cannot know how very much like perfection you are to this frail and bewitched sparrow.~
@100  = ~I did not intend it as such, no. 'Tis most telling that you would choose to interpret it thus, methinks.~
@101  = ~Come. I am certain we've dallied far longer than is sensible.~
@102  = ~Hah! Not if I grow bored of you first.~
@103  = ~Worried is it? No, 'tis not worry I feel, not truly. Something akin to it perhaps.~
@104  = ~Aye, I suppose your assessment is not entirely inaccurate, though I would not truly call it regret. Or perhaps it is regret, but not for the reasons you likely suspect.~
@105  = ~I bet you're regreting your little 'speech' by now.~
@106  = ~I feel terrible for what happened while we were... well, dead. Clearly I misled you to believe we were more than friends.~
@107  = ~I was wrong to dismiss your affections, Haer'Dalis. I love you.~
@108  = ~My dear <CHARNAME>, you are stronger than you believe. You would have succeeded even without my aid.~
@109  = ~No, it may have had nothing at all to do with anything on your part, my raven. The heart wants what it wants, after all.~
@110  = ~Worry not. 'Twas my fault for confusing intimacy with affection, my raven.~
@111  = ~Is friendship all we have? Is there no chance that you will return my sentiments someday?~
@112  = ~I think I already do. I love you, Haer'Dalis.~
@113  = ~There is most certainly a chance of that happening.~
@114  = ~Eh, maybe.~
@115  = ~Friendship is all we'll ever have, Haer'Dalis.~
@116  = ~I... Can this truly be? 'Tis as though the clouds have parted and bathed this sparrow's melancholy heart in glorious sunlight! Ah, my love, my love, give me your lips but for a moment!~
@117  = ~(Kiss him.)~
@118  = ~Oh, stop talking and kiss me!~
@119  = ~Wait until later. You're already distracting enough!~
@120  = ~I think I should make you earn it first.~
@121  = ~There's no time for that right now.~
@122  = ~(You can feel the bard smiling against your lips as he kisses you softly for a long, lingering moment. His hands frame your face, his thumbs stroking your cheeks, and he laughs softly under his breath when you part.)~
@123  = ~If this be a dream, I hope not to wake.~
@124  = ~'Tis my infinite pleasure to be your distraction.~
@125  = ~Ah, I do love a challenge.~
@126  = ~I vehemently disagree, but I shall bow to your wishes. I am far too delighted by this new knowledge to argue!~
@127  = ~Come, beloved raven, take my arm and walk with me a while. I suddenly find I cannot bear to take my eyes from you.~
@128  = ~Then I shall hold onto hope.~
@129  = ~I understand, my hound. Come, let us away from this place.~
@130  = ~Don't be silly! It was beautifully romantic, Haer'Dalis, even if I could not return your feelings.~
@131  = ~Ah, you are a romantic at heart, are you? That only makes it all the more tragic that you could not return my affection.~
@132  = ~I couldn't then, but I can now. I love you, Haer'Dalis, with all my heart.~
@133  = ~I'm sorry.~
@134  = ~I'd rather not talk about this right now.~
@135  = ~Maybe things would have been different if you hadn't backed me into a corner like you did!~
@136  = ~Yes, it was foolish of you to make a scene without knowing how I would respond.~
@137  = ~As am I.~
@138  = ~It was never my intention to make you feel caged, my dear <CHARNAME>, and I am truly sorry for the position I placed you in with my ill-timed declaration.~
@139  = ~'Twas a risk I was most willing to take, and one I would not hesitate to make again and again.~
@140  = ~Did it?~
@141  = ~No, you should not be. After all, I am not sorry, and it 'twas I who was being dragged.~
@142  = ~Aye, it was poor timing and poor taste for this humble bard to have laid himself bare in that moment.~
@143  = ~Aye, that is something I myself have thought and is part of the reason I now stand humbly before you, seeking your forgiveness.~
@144  = ~Oh, never mind that. It was a terribly romantic thing you did, even if I could not return your sentiment.~
@145  = ~If you ever get in my way again, Haer'Dalis, no amount of flowery prose will stop my wrath.~
@146  = ~As we move toward greater adventure still, I know that the affection for you that lingers in my heart will succumb to entropy's whims. But I do not wish it to fade too soon, even though it is laced with pain.~
@147  = ~Don't say that it will fade! Haer'Dalis, I love you!~
@148  = ~You are a wonderful friend, someone I might someday come to love in return. Whatever time we have together, I'm grateful for it. Let's not waste what we have on worry about when it will end.~
@149  = ~Tell yourself whatever lies you wish, bard.~
@150  = ~Haer'Dalis, give it up. I will never love you.~
@151  = ~Ah, my raven, my raven! Truly you cannot know how very much like perfection you are to this frail and bewitched sparrow.~
@152  = ~I always do.~
@153  = ~It occurs to me that I have yet to ask how you are recovering from your soul's absence, my raven. Tell me, how are you feeling now that you are whole once again?~
@154  = ~Wonderful! I've never felt better.~
@155  = ~It's such a relief. I wasn't sure I'd ever get it back.~
@156  = ~It's good to be myself again, that's for sure.~
@157  = ~I don't know. I still feel... off.~
@158  = ~I'm not the same person I was before this happened. Something's different, but I don't know what that means.~
@159  = ~This has only made me stronger. I feel the power within me, and now with the Slayer at my disposal, I will be truly unstoppable!~
@160  = ~Ah, I am most delighted to hear 'tis so! The light has returned to your eyes, and you seem no worse for your trials, my dear <CHARNAME>.~
@161  = ~Yes, it's a great relief.~
@162  = ~I expected the damage to be worse, frankly.~
@163  = ~I'm not surprised I escaped unscathed. Not after everything I'd been through before my soul was stolen.~
@164  = ~I didn't escape without my share of scars, of course.~
@165  = ~There's no way I'd let myself be permanently damaged by someone like Jon Irenicus.~
@166  = ~As did I, though this is one moment in which I am glad to be wrong. Let us hope nothing lurks beneath the surface to catch us unawares later, hmm?~
@167  = ~You did have far more preparation for such torments than the average berk, that much is certain.~
@168  = ~None of us do, my dear raven.~
@169  = ~I am loath to admit it, but he was far stronger and more cunning than I had expected. You may mock him now that the threat is gone, but I am truly surprised that we survived our encounters with the once-elf mage.~
@170  = ~Nor did I, truth be told. It seemed impossible to hope for a pleasant outcome.~
@171  = ~Yet here we stand!~
@172  = ~Indeed we do, my fine friend.~
@173  = ~I imagine so. 'Twould be awkward to be a stranger in one's own body.~
@174  = ~That's not an inaccurate description of how I felt, really.~
@175  = ~Aye, this I can see in your eyes as well. Mayhap in time you will regain the whole of what you once were, or at least grow to be comfortable in your own skin.~
@176  = ~I hope you're right.~
@177  = ~I'm just glad I survived.~
@178  = ~I don't know. I have a feeling I won't ever be as I was.~
@179  = ~It doesn't matter. I'm fine with the changes I feel inside me.~
@180  = ~I hope not. These changes have made me stronger.~
@181  = ~As am I, my raven.~
@182  = ~'Tis strange, but I feel a pang of sorrow at your words.~
@183  = ~If you are prone to change, perhaps you ought not grow o'er fond of these particular changes. They may be fleeting.~
@184  = ~I don't know if I like the sound of that. Perhaps the change is for the better? Let us hope so, for your sake and mine.~
@185  = ~The Slayer is a dangerous tool, aye, but a useful one no doubt. I would urge you to employ some measure of caution, though I know not if you will heed my advice.~
@186  = ~I'm not going to make the same mistakes Sarevok did. Don't worry about that.~
@187  = ~I will not squander what I have, and I will be careful how I use the power at my disposal.~
@188  = ~We shall see, won't we?~
@189  = ~(snort) Caution is for cowards. I will do what I wish, when I wish.~
@190  = ~Save your advice for someone who needs it. I know what I'm doing.~
@191  = ~Well, thank the Lady for small favors then.~
@192  = ~Aye, very reassuring...~
@193  = ~If nothing else, you make for an interesting traveling companion. We are never short on action, drama and belligerence.~
@194  = ~Ah, yes of course. How could I ever have you confused with a Clueless berk being led about by her nose?~
@195  = ~These struggles you endured were terribly worrisome to this poor bard. To watch you fading and know that I was helpless to aid you was not a pleasant experience in the least.~
@196  = ~You did more for me than you realize.~
@197  = ~It could have been worse for all of us.~
@198  = ~Well pardon me for making *your* life so difficult!~
@199  = ~I didn't need your help, Haer'Dalis. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself.~
@200  = ~I don't want to talk about this anymore.~
@201  = ~How so? Certainly not with my flapping lips and useless hand-wringing!~
@202  = ~Actually, those things did help.~
@203  = ~Maybe not so much the hand-wringing, but I was always grateful to hear your voice.~
@204  = ~You were there. That's all that mattered.~
@205  = ~You fought my enemies at my side. You faced my trials with me and never flinched.~
@206  = ~Yeah, you're right. You were pretty useless.~
@207  = ~Hah! Surely you jest.~
@208  = ~You made me feel normal when everyone else was treating me like a monster.~
@209  = ~Everything you did helped distract me from the horrors going on around me and within me. You let me *forget*, even if it was only for a few moments at a time.~
@210  = ~Think what you will.~
@211  = ~Yes, I do. The things you said were hurtful and selfish. If anything, you made it harder for me to keep going forward!~
@212  = ~Yeah, I wasn't really listening to you then. Kind of like right now.~
@213  = ~I am glad I could be of some help to you then. You have my gratitude for telling me this.~
@214  = ~'Tis regrettable that you feel thus. I never intended to bring you pain, my raven.~
@215  = ~Even when I said things you did not wish to hear?~
@216  = ~Even then.~
@217  = ~I don't recall any moments like that.~
@218  = ~Well, maybe not all the time...~
@219  = ~Yeah, now that you mention it, you weren't very supportive at all, were you?~
@220  = ~Just accept the compliment and move on, Haer'Dalis.~
@221  = ~You are an amazing woman.~
@222  = ~'Tis no great wonder that I am so fully enamored of you, is it? No, indeed it is not.~
@223  = ~Ah, then you are either being kind or you have a very poor memory. Either way, I should be grateful.~
@224  = ~Hah! Indeed.~
@225  = ~As you command, oh wise <CHARNAME>.~
@226  = ~Is it really? You are a rare woman indeed if you say that in full sincerity.~
@227  = ~How odd. I know not how it happened or when it happened or *why* it happened, but it seems I've become a rather *loyal* man! Who would have expected that? Not I, that is certain.~
@228  = ~They say love does that to a man.~
@229  = ~I'm glad for that.~
@230  = ~You mean I'm stuck with you? Oh, woe is me!~
@231  = ~I'm sure your loyalty will end someday.~
@232  = ~Bah, I don't need you clinging to me!~
@233  = ~Aye, that they do. But 'they' are all fools and gossipmongers, so what do they truly know?~
@234  = ~As am I, strangely enough.~
@235  = ~Tsk, that also means I am stuck with you! Let us both wallow in self-pity for the company of the other!~
@236  = ~As am I, but 'someday' could be far off. Or it could be tomorrow! Who's to say?~
@237  = ~You should wear an apron that I might tug at the strings, my hound.~
@238  = ~Ah, my hound, as always your particular brand of honesty is both refreshing and soul-crushing.~
@239  = ~That is very true. I will not think of what might have become of you had we not recovered that which was taken from you.~
@240  = ~You are forgiven.~
@241  = ~Oh, you should see the look on your face, my dear raven! Hah! But I did not mean to imply that I had the worst of things. I only wished to express how difficult it was to see you suffering as you were.~
@242  = ~I know. Without a shadow of a doubt, I know. But not everything in life is about need and ability. Sometimes it is about want and comfort.~
@243  = ~I know. Forgive me if I sounded ungrateful.~
@244  = ~You're a distraction, Haer'Dalis, one I don't know how to ignore. One I don't *want* to ignore.~
@245  = ~I suppose you're right.~
@246  = ~Those things are distractions. I won't be distracted by you, tiefling.~
@247  = ~I don't need a lecture from you of all people.~
@248  = ~There is nothing to forgive.~
@249  = ~Then do not. I am here, now and as long as I draw breath, longing for your touch, your gaze, your words. All I ask is that you do not torment me - either you love me or you do not.~
@250  = ~Your heart will not be denied, nor will mine. If you decide to cast me aside for the sake of your ambition, I ask only that you do it quickly. But know that I will not cease to love you even should you choose to shatter this fragile affection.~
@251  = ~If you feel the need to speak these words, then clearly I have already distracted you. And I cannot say I regret that in the least.~
@252  = ~Aye, it seems it would be meaningless even should I waste my breath.~
@253  = ~I understand. We have places to go that await us impatiently.~
@254  = ~I am pleased to be alive today, my raven. And I find even greater pleasure knowing that today I am both alive and at your side.~
@255  = ~(As you pause during a rare moment of calm, Haer'Dalis moves silently to your side. His fingertips whisper up your arm to gently brush against the exposed skin on the back of your neck.)~
@256  = ~(Lean into his touch.)~
@257  = ~(Turn your head and smile at him.)~
@258  = ~(Close your eyes and sigh.)~
@259  = ~(Ignore him.)~
@260  = ~(Shrug his hand away.)~
@261  = ~(Step reluctantly away.)~

@264  = ~(Laugh.)~
@265  = ~(Elbow him playfully.)~
@266  = ~(Roll your eyes and shake your head.)~
@267  = ~(Turn to embrace him.)~
@268  = ~We've no time for such silliness.~
@269  = ~(The tiefling chuckles warmly and lets his fingers linger for a moment longer. Almost as an afterthought, he leans in to press a soft kiss against your cheek before he retreats.)~
@270  = ~(A sound that resembles both a chuckle and a growl rumbles from low in his throat as he leans to press his lips against your ear.)~
@271  = ~If you only knew how the sound of your delightful laughter tortures your humble sparrow, my love...~
@272  = ~(He nuzzles the side of your throat, his breath hot against your skin. Suddenly he pulls away, wearing a playful expression of mock-torment at your supposed 'torture,' then he sighs in resignation and gestures for you to carry on with your tasks.)~
@273  = ~(The tiefling clutches his ribs and feigns an injury, then flashes you a smirk and a wink before returning to the task at hand.)~
@274  = ~(Haer'Dalis pulls you tight against him despite the protesting squeak of leather and metal between you. The embrace lasts for a long, comforting moment before he releases you with a tender smile that softens his impossibly dark eyes.)~
@275  = ~If 'tis truth you speak, then we ought to make time.~
@276  = ~(His answering smile is lopsided and uncharacteristically honest as he sidles closer to you. His wandering fingers linger on your neck for a moment then drift down your spine before he leans in to press a featherlight kiss against the side of your throat.)~
@277  = ~(Sigh appreciatively and lean in toward him.)~
@278  = ~(Push him firmly away.)~
@279  = ~(The bard murmurs his approval and the hand on your back curls tightly around your waist to pull you closer as his lips seek your neck again. There is hot, damp breath against your tender skin, then soft lips... then the gentle scrape of teeth once... twice...)~

@281  = ~Forgive me. 'Twould seem you are a severe burden upon my self-control.~
@282  = ~Don't apologize!~
@283  = ~I'm not complaining, Haer'Dalis.~
@284  = ~It's fine. Let's just go.~
@285  = ~No, it was my fault. I invited your attention.~
@286  = ~Please don't cross that line again.~
@287  = ~Don't you *ever* do that without my permission! Understand?~
@288  = ~(The tiefling's gaze is heavy and heated.)~
@289  = ~Mayhap you will be the death of me after all.~
@290  = ~Off with us then.~
@291  = ~Perhaps, but I was foolish to take advantage. Let us not linger on it.~
@292  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@293  = ~I... We must stop now, or I shall surely have my way with you right here.~
@294  = ~(He looks positively agonized as he pulls back and moves stiffly off ahead of you.)~
@295  = ~(Haer'Dalis frowns, but his disappointment appears to be directed at himself rather than you.)~
@296  = ~Forgive my foolish behavior, my raven. I did not mean to offend.~
@297  = ~Tsk, silly bard! I'm just playing hard to get.~
@298  = ~(Haer'Dalis sighs loudly, but obediently steps away from you, muttering something about 'torment' and 'cruelty' under his breath.)~
@299  = ~(Haer'Dalis narrows his eyes and moves away from you.)~
@300  = ~(The bard moves to stand in front of you, his hand sliding from your neck to your chin to angle your face toward his. When he speaks, his voice is laced with concern.)~
@301  = ~Are you unwell, my raven?~
@302  = ~That was a happy sigh.~
@303  = ~(Slide your arms around him.)~
@304  = ~I'm better now that you're here.~
@305  = ~A little. It will pass.~
@306  = ~(Turn your face so he can't see the tears in your eyes.)~
@307  = ~Horrible, in fact.~
@308  = ~I was here all along, dearest. Come, take my hand a while.~
@309  = ~As will all things. If there is anything I can do for you, all you need do is ask.~
@310  = ~As will all things. Remember that I love you, raven of my heart.~
@311  = ~My sweet <CHARNAME>...~
@312  = ~(Haer'Dalis pulls you tight against him despite the protesting squeak of leather and metal between you. The embrace lasts for a long, comforting moment before he releases you with a tender, sorrowful expression that softens his impossibly dark eyes.)~
@313  = ~(The bard's touch lingers for a moment more before he lets his hand slide away and turns from you.)~
@314  = ~(The bard moves to stand in front of you, his brow furrowed in concern.)~
@315  = ~I'm sorry. I shouldn't take my foul moods out on you.~
@316  = ~I just don't want to be touched right now.~
@317  = ~(Turn your face she he can't see the tears in your eyes.)~
@318  = ~No apology necessary. Just know that I am here if you have need of me.~
@319  = ~Aye, this sparrow understands and respectfully retreats.~
@320  = ~You know where I can be found should you change your mind, my raven.~
@321  = ~(The bard's hand hangs in empty air for a moment, his dark eyes following your movements, then slowly descends back to his side.)~
@322  = ~I wonder something, my raven. What sort of romantic tale would you say is best? A passionate affair? Eternal love? Tragedy?~
@323  = ~I don't think I prefer one sort in particular. Whether or not I enjoy the tale would depend on more than just its conclusion.~
@324  = ~Oh, I do enjoy a good 'happily ever after.' There's something endearing about a story of true love.~
@325  = ~I've always had a weakness for those scandalous books with heaving bosoms and rippling muscles.~
@326  = ~Tragedies have always touched me the deepest.~
@327  = ~I've never given it much thought.~
@328  = ~I can't stand romantic tales of any sort.~
@329  = ~Ah, then we are much alike in this regard. I, too, look to the whole of a tale before I make my judgement of the work. Though I must say, a botched ending can thoroughly destroy even the most remarkable of narratives.~
@330  = ~Yes, that sort of tale seems quite popular with females, those of the Prime especially. These have never held my attention overlong, I admit.~
@331  = ~Is that so? My word, I did not expect that, my salacious raven! But perhaps I should have.~
@332  = ~The same is true for this bard as well. Often those tales strike a certain chord of believability that other tales lack.~
@333  = ~Ah, that might explain a few things...~
@334  = ~And yet you are right now acting one out with your fair sparrow. Mayhap you like them more than you believe, my darling love.~
@335  = ~I only posed the question to you because I have of late thought on the elven queen Ellesime and her fallen consort, your soul-thief. 'Tis such a beautifully tragic tale, do you not think? And such a dramatic conclusion! Ah, 'tis the stuff epic ballads are made of, my raven.~
@336  = ~I've thought the same thing. They were a truly tragic pair.~
@337  = ~What happened between them was terribly sad.~
@338  = ~It's not really something I've thought about.~
@339  = ~I have a hard time seeing Irenicus as anything but the man who tortured and hunted me.~
@340  = ~If you had seen Jon's dungeon below Athkatla, you might think differently.~
@341  = ~The fools deserved each other.~
@342  = ~'Beautifully tragic?' What rot! Jon Irenicus was a butcher, and Queen Ellesime was a coward! I will not romanticize them in any way!~
@343  = ~Aye, indeed. Love blinded her to his faults until it was too late to change his course, and even then she could not bring herself to do what needed to be done.~
@344  = ~I wonder what they were like before Jon allowed his ambitions to consume him, back when their love was new.~
@345  = ~She couldn't have known he would carry out such evil acts after his exile. I think she did the best she could.~
@346  = ~Blind indeed! How can a woman not realize what her lover is planning?~
@347  = ~What's done is done. There's nothing that can change it all now.~
@348  = ~If she had executed him, I would not have been kidnapped, tortured, hunted, hounded and robbed of my soul! Her hesitation cost me much, and that's a debt that cannot be repaid.~
@349  = ~He's dead and rotting now. That's all that matters.~
@350  = ~That I wonder as well! 'Tis difficult to imagine that masked and twisted man as a young and beautiful elf, but to think of the two of them sitting 'neath the trees of spring, their cheeks bright with the blush of new love... (sigh)~
@351  = ~The forgiveness you grant so readily astounds this sparrow, my sweet <CHARNAME>. 'Tis doubtful that anyone else in your place could do the same.~
@352  = ~'Tis fair to assume that Irenicus did not flaunt his lust for power, and mayhap Ellesime merely dismissed any oddities as nothing worth worrying over. With those things said, I do agree with you, my raven. This sparrow struggles to comprehend such willful ignorance.~
@353  = ~I give my hearty concurrence to that, <CHARNAME>. How much pain Queen Ellesime could have saved both you and herself if she had not balked in the face of killing that vile betrayer!~
@354  = ~One might see it that way, surely, but they were once very much in love. It could very well have been quite different in the long years before our eyes beheld the broken remnant left behind.~
@355  = ~Even so, how can a woman not realize what her lover is planning?~
@356  = ~He's dead and rotting now. I don't care about anything else.~
@357  = ~In light of all he put you through, I cannot blame you for such a narrow view of the man.~
@358  = ~I don't blame the queen, though. She couldn't have known he would carry out such evil acts after his exile.~
@359  = ~What I don't understand is how the queen could have been so blind! How can a woman not realize what her lover is planning?~
@360  = ~If Ellesime had executed him, I would not have been kidnapped, tortured, hunted, hounded and robbed of my soul! Her hesitation cost me much, and that's a debt that cannot be repaid.~
@361  = ~Oh? What have you not told me?~
@362  = ~He had created *copies* of the queen, Haer'Dalis, and he would... use them...~
@363  = ~There were women down there, some who resembled the queen and others who were just random victims he'd gathered. He did horrific things to them, Haer'Dalis.~
@364  = ~He had bodies on tables, cut open and left to rot. They weren't just killed - they were dissected, picked apart and studied.~
@365  = ~The things I saw down there were so horrible that they turned *my* stomach. That should tell you just how bad it was.~
@366  = ~I don't want to think about it, but trust me, he was a sick, sick man.~
@367  = ~Copies, you say? Not abducted women who resembled her in appearance, but actual doppelgangers? Incredible! Do you know the purpose of these women?~
@368  = ~He was trying to recapture the emotions he'd once felt for Ellesime.~
@369  = ~When he was banished and his elven soul was stripped away, Irenicus lost the ability to feel emotions as other elves do. Perhaps he was seeking some means to restore that connection.~
@370  = ~Slaves, perhaps? A means of revenge against the woman who had caused him such suffering?~
@371  = ~I don't know.~
@372  = ~I don't care. He was a sick bastard.~
@373  = ~Ah, tragedy upon tragedy! Though I wish nothing but the torments of the deepest hells upon him, truly I do pity the tragic figure that is Jon Irenicus.~
@374  = ~No need to say more.~
@375  = ~Your words paint a picture reminiscent of my childhood.~
@376  = ~I suspect the mad mage had fallen very, very far from the elf he once was. It could well be that little to nothing remained of the man Ellesime had once loved.~
@377  = ~A veritable ocean of poor choices rose in the wake of those two, that is true. Love can blind, bind and make us fools in an instant, my raven, but I suppose that is little comfort to one who has been so deeply hurt by their poor choices.~
@378  = ~Forgive me, my dear <CHARNAME>. 'Twas not my intent to see you upset. Consider the subject forevermore forgotten.~
@379  = ~No, wait... I overreacted. Please, continue your thoughts.~
@380  = ~Thank you.~
@381  = ~Good.~
@382  = ~Stupid, insensitive, bastard *bard*...~
@383  = ~If you so much as mention the name of Jon Irenicus or his former whore, I will make you regret you ever met me. Understand?~
@384  = ~If you are certain...~
@385  = ~You've nearly managed to accomplish that already, my hound.~
@386  = ~'Tis a pity I did not ask the lovely queen if she carried regret for the love she'd once given her disgraced mage. If she had never given him her heart, a great many devastating and terrible acts might been averted. But to regret love seems a grave injustice in itself.~
@387  = ~Love is worth the cost. Even if it ends in pain, even if it makes us act like fools, it's not something that should be cast aside or thought of with regret.~
@388  = ~It wasn't loving him that caused all those problems. She should have been stronger when everything fell apart.~
@389  = ~I have to question just how genuine this 'love' of theirs was if she didn't even know him well enough to recognize the danger he posed to their people!~
@390  = ~Love that is poisonous should be regretted. Whatever was between them was a twisted, ugly thing.~
@391  = ~I hope it broke her heart all over again when I cut him down. Maybe she'll learn to be more selective about her lovers in the future.~
@392  = ~I don't give a damn what she feels.~
@393  = ~You speak with great passion, my raven. I will remember your words.~
@394  = ~I am pleased to hear you say this. Whatever comes of us, I would never wish for you to regret that which we've shared, my love.~
@395  = ~'Tis possible you do not understand just how difficult it can be to see the truth of a matter when gazing through the rose-tinted glass of love. This bard struggles with such things, and I find myself puzzling over your words. You see, were it not for her love for the mad mage, Ellesime would have undoubtedly had that strength to do what was necessary.~
@396  = ~Not all who experience love possess the ability to separate emotion and attachment from rational thought. While I agree with your words in theory, I do know well that it is far more difficult to accomplish in practice.~
@397  = ~Perhaps you speak true, but I have no wish to question the authenticity of their love.~
@398  = ~Clearly one or both of them was holding back much from the other. Either he kept his true self hidden or she did not allow herself to know him as she ought. Perhaps they were doomed from the start.~
@399  = ~You have no way to know if it was always thus, my raven. Beauty that was tortured and scarred was still once beautiful.~
@400  = ~The heart wants what it wants, aye? Even that which is worst for it.~
@401  = ~If I am any judge, 'tis unlikely that Ellesime will ever let herself truly love again.~
@402  = ~Harsh words, my beloved hound. Let us hope someone does not one day speak them back to you.~
@403  = ~And here we stand, but fond companions discussing the lost love of two people we scarcely know. I cannot help but muse what strangers will say of the connection between you and I one hundred years from now.~
@404  = ~And here we stand, but two lovers discussing the lost love of two people we scarcely know. I cannot help but muse what strangers will say of the love between you and I one hundred years from now.~
@405  = ~If I were a man of honor, what vows would I speak? If I were a man of numbers, how might I calculate the sum of my actions? If I were a man of infinite tomorrows... would I have enough time to find that which has wandered astray...?~
@406  = ~If I were a woman of simplicity, would you have given this raven a second glance?~
@407  = ~Uh... what?~
@408  = ~What's wrong, Haer'Dalis?~
@409  = ~Poetry, my sparrow?~
@410  = ~Just speak plainly, please.~
@411  = ~We've no time for your nonsense!~
@412  = ~What are you on about now, fool?~
@413  = ~The act can only be maintained for so long, aye? We cannot be other than what we truly are, even 'neath the protection of our many masks.~
@414  = ~My affection is for you as you are, not for any echo of who you might have been.~
@415  = ~If I have given voice to confusion itself, it is only because confusion alone rules o'er me this day. (sigh) You know not what you do to this poor bard.~
@416  = ~Everything, nothing and not enough all at once! (sigh) You know not what you do to this poor bard.~
@417  = ~*Life* is poetry.~
@418  = ~Truly I must be a fool to entertain your surly snarls and disdainful glances. (sigh) My hound, you know not what you do to this poor bard.~
@419  = ~Ah, but you do so confound this worthless sparrow! My words are as much a weapon as my blades, my fierce and lovely raven, yet in your presence this tongue is so often rendered useless! 'Tis maddening and fascinating, cruel and enticing all at once!~
@420  = ~I feel the same way when I try to talk to you.~
@421  = ~Ah-ha, I understand now! You get tongue-tied around me, and it's making you crazy.~
@422  = ~Does poor Haer'Dalis find himself at a loss for words? How *tragic*.~
@423  = ~What good is a bard who cannot find his tongue?~
@424  = ~I'm sorry, but I'm not trying to cause you problems.~
@425  = ~Don't blame me for your own ineptitude, bard.~
@426  = ~Can this be true? Does your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth and leave you grinning like an addled fool instead of spewing forth a witty retort?~
@427  = ~That, and worse! Sometimes I feel like a babbling idiot when we talk!~
@428  = ~That's exactly how you make me feel.~
@429  = ~I was just trying to be kind...~
@430  = ~No, of course not.~
@431  = ~Hah, you're less an 'addled fool' and more a 'love-struck fool!'~
@432  = ~I'm warning you, bard. If you even *think* about mocking me...~
@433  = ~What is this satisfaction I feel blossom in my chest at your words? 'Tis surely madness that your shared discomfort would bring me some form of pleasure.~
@434  = ~Ah, this pain in my heart says your kindness is cruelty!~
@435  = ~Well, I am surely *delighted* for you, oh deceitful one.~
@436  = ~Less and less by the day, my hound. Less and less by the day.~
@437  = ~Aye, hogtied by your breastbinding and subjected to the cruel lashings of your tongue is what this love-struck bard be!~
@438  = ~I seek commiseration, and you fear for your ego? I should not be surprised.~
@439  = ~Such cruel mockery! Such pain you doth shower upon your ever-loyal and frail sparrow! Woe is me, and woe is my poor, useless tongue!~
@440  = ~Believe it or not, I feel the same way when I try to talk to you.~
@441  = ~Your tongue seems to be doing just fine right now.~
@442  = ~Oh, your talented tongue is *very* useful.~
@443  = ~Useless indeed, especially behind closed doors...~
@444  = ~I am so confused right now.~
@445  = ~Will you please calm down and tell me what's wrong with you?~
@446  = ~Oh, shut your trap, bard!~
@447  = ~I... It has good moments and bad when you are near. I declare this moment to be an exception and not the rule! Yes.~
@448  = ~Hah, yes well... Oh, but that is not fair play! I speak of singing to your ears, not singing to your... more delightfully soft and rounded parts...~
@449  = ~A challenge, is it? I shall have you shrieking the praises of my tongue's talent before long, this I swear.~
@450  = ~I know this, but still you are the cause! What have you done to me, oh cunning manipulator of the mind?~
@451  = ~You know, I feel the same way when I try to talk to you.~
@452  = ~Ah, how rewarding to see that all those spells I've secretly been casting on you are finally paying off.~
@453  = ~'Manipulator?' If that isn't the pot calling the kettle black!~
@454  = ~I swear I've done nothing to you!~
@455  = ~A confession! And given so freely that I cannot tell if it is truth or further lies... Bah, I am back to where I first begun!~
@456  = ~*I* manipulate *you*? A baseless accusation if ever I heard one!~
@457  = ~Well, if that is true... How very disappointed I am.~
@458  = ~Oh, but I do! 'Twas not until you sunk your claws into me that I began to lose all sense of reason!~
@459  = ~Hah! That's pretty believable, actually.~
@460  = ~What?! It's *you* who won't let go of *me*!~
@461  = ~If you don't shut your trap, bard, I'll really show you my claws!~
@462  = ~Must you look so insufferably smug about it?~
@463  = ~Are these the lies you tell yourself to help you sleep at night? Keep them in your mind where they belong. I'll not hear them!~
@464  = ~This sparrow likely sounds as bally as an angry abishai in a bar full of drunken tanar'ri, but my lips have a mind all their own, my raven. 'Twould be a lie to say I have never met anyone who baffled my wit and forestalled my thoughts as you do, but I have traveled in your company longer than I have with any other.~
@465  = ~(sigh) Alas, perhaps I hoped I would feel some relief having confessed my difficulty to you.~
@466  = ~I'm glad you told me.~
@467  = ~You don't feel at all better?~
@468  = ~Haer'Dalis, we both know you don't have any trouble speaking your mind around me. What's this really about?~
@469  = ~So, all that crazy stuff you just said... You were just venting your frustration?~
@470  = ~Great. Now you've given me a headache.~
@471  = ~If you're quite finished being even more of a fool than usual, I have more important things to deal with.~
@472  = ~Why?~
@473  = ~It makes me feel closer to you.~
@474  = ~Vulnerability from you is rare.~
@475  = ~Because I like knowing that we have the same effect on one another.~
@476  = ~It's nice to know my manipulation techniques are working as planned.~
@477  = ~You've revealed yet another weakness I can exploit.~
@478  = ~You, my dear, are far too sweet for the likes of this sparrow. I am infinitely pleased to be in your fair presence, even if you are the cause of my tongue's woes.~
@479  = ~Aye. One might even say it is rare enough to be nonexistent. Who can truly know the truth? I keep it hidden even from myself.~
@480  = ~We share a shortcoming, and that pleases you? Hah, but it seems I feel the same... How odd.~
@481  = ~You read my mind at times, hound, for I was just entertaining similar thoughts.~
@482  = ~Or another decoy to chase, mayhap? You are so very easily led astray, my dark hound.~
@483  = ~On the contrary, I feel more the fool than e're before. I am naught but a silly Doomguard, and what use does the multiverse have for a jester of entropy?~
@484  = ~I'll gladly take you if the multiverse doesn't want you, my sparrow.~
@485  = ~It's interesting to see a rare moment of vulnerability from you.~
@486  = ~Still, I like knowing that we have the same effect on one another.~
@487  = ~You *are* pretty useless.~
@488  = ~(sigh) These conversations sorely test my hold over the Slayer.~
@489  = ~Yet I remain at your side even so. Either I have some use that you deny, or you practice poor judgement by keeping a useless fool underfoot. Look to yourself for the answer.~
@490  = ~Oh? That is very useful knowledge indeed...~
@491  = ~Mayhap it has all been but a ruse to throw you off the scent, my hound. Were you to peel away the layers of lies around this bard, is it impossible that you will find a fearful and fragile heart beats within my breast?~
@492  = ~If it does, it would be a mirror image of my own heart.~
@493  = ~Well, then we have the same effect on one another.~
@494  = ~Then I would handle your heart with great care.~
@495  = ~You'd best hope that's not the case. I don't tolerate weakness.~
@496  = ~Threaten, threaten, *threaten*! Truly my raven, you must add more variety to your act, if only to cure the ennui of your poor audience.~
@497  = ~Am I not entitled? Have I not earned my right to spout worthless complaints for no other purpose than to hear the sound of my own voice?~
@498  = ~Indeed you have. Complain away!~
@499  = ~Must you?~
@500  = ~I think we all hear too much of your voice as it is.~
@501  = ~Make it quick, bard. Time is wasting!~
@502  = ~What sort of question is that? Yes, I most certainly must! Silly raven. And... And now I've utterly forgotten my purpose in this speech.~
@503  = ~How fitting.~
@504  = ~What nonsense. There is no such thing as 'too much' of my lovely voice, my hound. And... And now I've utterly forgotten my purpose in this speech.~
@505  = ~(sigh) One cannot rush art, my raven. How is it possible that my muse stifles my muse? And... And now I've utterly forgotten my purpose in this speech.~
@506  = ~Wonderful! You have broken my tongue, and I have broken your head - a most fair trade indeed!~
@507  = ~Yes, yes, whatever would you do if you were denied your daily allotment of being dismissive and superior, aye?~

@521  = ~Stop fussing with it! Wait until we stop to rest, or you'll be distracted if we're attacked.~
@522  = ~Spiteful woman, how can you mock my agony? I will consider granting you forgiveness if you'll only come and help this helpless bard!~
@523  = ~Okay, just hold still and let me look.~
@524  = ~Oh, stop fussing with it! Wait until we stop to rest, or you'll be distracted if we're attacked.~
@525  = ~What?! My hound, would you ask me to sever my finger because my hands had been muddied? Would you amputate my leg if I wore a hole in my breeches? I will not simply hack off my hair because of a little tangle!~
@526  = ~You don't think you're being a little dramatic about this?~
@527  = ~(sigh) You are not helping. Either aid this sparrow, or leave him to flounder.~

@539  = ~No, it's a piece of a tree branch, I think.~
@540  = ~No, but it is disgusting. Don't you ever wash?~
@541  = ~No, but I'm still not touching it.~
@542  = ~You think you can so easily deceive a deceiver? I think not, <CHARNAME>.~
@543  = ~Can you remove it?~

@569  = ~(Slice through a large swath of his hair.)~
@570  = ~On second thought, I'll just let you handle this.~
@571  = ~(The bard accepts his knife back and gives the knot a forelorn stare.)~
@572  = ~I thank you for your help. (sigh) Come, let us be off, lest you soon see this sparrow weep like a mourning widower...~
@573  = ~(The bard jerks away before the knife can touch his hair and whirls on you to snatch the blade away with preternatural speed. There is a flash of genuine hurt in his narrow-eyed stare, and after a pause, he shakes his head.)~
@574  = ~We are done here, hound.~
@575  = ~My raven, my muse, have I told you of late how your loveliness bewitches this helpless bard? Truly, your beauty drives me to distraction!~
@576  = ~I do have an abundance of assets, don't I?~
@577  = ~I'm so tired of hearing that.~
@578  = ~I could certainly be uglier, I suppose.~
@579  = ~My looks are nothing special, Haer'Dalis.~
@580  = ~Are you mocking me?~
@581  = ~I think you need your eyes checked.~
@582  = ~Humans are somewhat bland compared to other races.~
@583  = ~You find humans attractive?~
@584  = ~Many races find elves attractive.~
@585  = ~You find elves attractive?~
@586  = ~It seems like many people find half-elves attractive.~
@587  = ~Most people look down on half-elves. ~
@588  = ~You find half-elves attractive?~
@589  = ~I hear 'cute' far more often than 'beautiful.'~
@590  = ~Most big folk wouldn't agree with you.~
@591  = ~You find halflings attractive?~
@592  = ~I've been called 'cute,' but never 'beautiful.'~
@593  = ~You find gnomes attractive?~
@594  = ~Ha-ha-ha! You *must* be joking!~
@595  = ~Look, if you want to upset me, you're doing a fine job of it.~
@596  = ~No other man in all the Realms would agree with you.~
@597  = ~You find half-orcs attractive?~
@598  = ~Dwarves are many things, but I'm not sure 'beautiful' is one of them.~
@599  = ~Most people wouldn't agree with you.~
@600  = ~You find dwarves attractive?~
@601  = ~Thank you. It's nice to know you think I'm beautiful.~
@602  = ~Haer'Dalis, I have scars on top of my scars. And you really expect me to believe you think I'm beautiful?~
@603  = ~Why this sudden flattery?~
@604  = ~Oh, what nonsense! The diversity of the human form is astounding, my dear raven, and the various flavors and nuances are most intriguing.~
@605  = ~Aye, your people bear an ethereal appearance that draws the eye, that much is certain.~
@606  = ~Half-elves are curious creatures, bearing both the fascinating diversity of the human parent and the delicate details of the elven parent. On the surface alone, I might say I find them most attractive of all races, though perhaps that is because I myself am half elven.~
@607  = ~Oh, you most certainly are cute, my tiny raven. If you find that patronizing, you may simply pretend I never said it. That will not make it any less true, though.~
@608  = ~That is most unfortunate, my tiny raven, for while you are indeed cute, you are also unerringly beautiful as well.~
@609  = ~There are a great many things about your half-orc blood that are delightful and captivating. Yours are a strong and proud people, and there is great beauty to be found in such traits.~
@610  = ~Then we must agree to disagree on that, my little raven.~
@611  = ~I find *you* attractive, my dear sweet <CHARNAME>. The others of your race are inconsequential to me.~
@612  = ~They are fools, all of them. 'Tis their loss and my gain, and glad I am for that.~
@613  = ~These markings upon your skin are a map of your life, my raven, stories of your struggles written in pain and triumph. How could I ever find your scars less than breathtaking?~
@614  = ~I speak honesty and you call it flattery? I wonder at times if there is any way to please you.~
@615  = ~But surely you know me better than to believe I refer to outward beauty? While 'tis pleasant enough to look upon a fair face or well-sculpted curves for a moment, true beauty flows from that which is not physical. Such radiance lasts far, far longer than our fading skin and dimming eyes.~
@616  = ~You admire what I accomplish through my combat skills, then?~
@617  = ~You like my keen mind, then?~
@618  = ~You love me for my keen mind, then?~
@619  = ~I've caught you admiring my backside too often to fully believe you.~
@620  = ~A lovely sentiment.~
@621  = ~I've heard this claim before, but I'm not sure I believe the people who say it.~
@622  = ~So... you don't find me physically attractive?~
@623  = ~That so called 'inner beauty' still fades and dies eventually.~
@624  = ~I think you're full of rubbish. I've never met a man who wasn't fully wrapped up in physical lust.~
@625  = ~There are few things in life more satisfying than watching your skills at work, my fierce <CHARNAME>. Yes, I do indeed admire the beauty of your abilities very much.~
@626  = ~'Tis a devious and cunning mind you have, and I do very much appreciate it. And, of course, 'tis always better to follow a person of intelligence than one who is a fool, aye? Consider me then not simply appreciative, but grateful as well!~
@627  = ~Aye, my love. And for many other reasons besides.~
@628  = ~And such a lovely backside it is... But I assure you, that is not all I see when I turn my eyes upon you, fair lady.~
@629  = ~Oh, certainly it is a line that has seen much use and even more abuse, but I assure you that it is truth from my lips.~
@630  = ~That is not at all what I meant to imply! My raven, if you'd but give me the chance, I would prove to you over and over again that I am most assuredly attracted to your physical form. But, I suppose now is not the time for such lurid talk.~
@631  = ~My raven, do you think me the sort to tear the clothes from a woman I find distasteful? Such odd questions you ask of me at times. I merely wished to say that my desire for you does not begin and end between your fair thighs.~
@632  = ~Aye, there is no hiding from entropy, but that is all the more reason why we should enjoy the beauty around us while it yet lasts.~
@633  = ~Then you need to meet better men, my hound.~
@634  = ~What of you? What does beauty mean to my <CHARNAME>? Is it physical, or something else? Does it hold any importance at all?~
@635  = ~I'm shamelessly shallow, my sparrow. I like pretty things. And pretty people.~
@636  = ~I can't deny that I enjoy a pleasing body or face, but all that can be ruined by a foul personality.~
@637  = ~Each person has a unique sort of beauty. It isn't something I can define by a few general traits, physical or otherwise.~
@638  = ~A keen mind is far more attractive than a pleasing physique.~
@639  = ~I find power very attractive.~
@640  = ~Beauty is battle. Beauty is the spray of blood that hangs in the air after a killing blow. Beauty is the silence that descends upon the field after the war is won.~
@641  = ~Ah, how I delight in your honesty! And I shall take that as a compliment as well.~
@642  = ~We are very much in agreement on that. If ever you travel the Planes, you will see for yourself just how deceptive outward appearances can be.~
@643  = ~You are wiser than I, my dear, for that is a very fair point indeed. And 'tis a good thing, too, for the Realms would not be nearly so amusing if we were all the same.~
@644  = ~In my youth, I would have sneered at such words, but I have long since learned the truth of them.~
@645  = ~My hound, I do not find that revelation surprising in the least.~
@646  = ~Oh, Daughter of Bhaal, how your words doth chill my heart yet heat my blood in the same breath. You are chaos in flesh and blood form.~
@647  = ~Before we wander off to our next adventure, know that though this bard is an actor, and this actor's tongue does tell untruths with easy grace, these words I offer you now are not false.~
@648  = ~You are beautiful to me in so many ways, I do not know that I could ever do my affection justice with words alone. Truly, idle flattery would be easier, for I would not have to suffer this strange tightness across my chest when we speak.~
@649  = ~And now that I have said far too much, surely we must be off, aye?~
@650  = ~Tell me, my dear, what is the taste of power? What flavor does it leave upon your delightful tongue?~
@651  = ~It's sweet, Haer'Dalis. Very sweet indeed.~
@652  = ~It tastes bitter. Like many other things in my life.~
@653  = ~That's a complicated question.~
@654  = ~Can't you just ask a question like a normal person?~
@655  = ~Power? What *power*?~
@656  = ~Power, my raven, is a subject, an idea, an *ideal*, some would say, with which you have much familiarity, aye? The power you wield over life and death, the power of the Slayer, even the power of prophecy opens before you and haunts you like a shadow! This sparrow simply wonders if all this agrees with your delicate sensibilities.~
@657  = ~'Delicate sensibilities,' huh?~
@658  = ~Sometimes it does, other times it doesn't.~
@659  = ~Fine, fine. Power is sweet, Haer'Dalis. Very sweet indeed.~
@660  = ~Oh, very well. It tastes bitter. Like many other things in my life.~
@661  = ~Questions of power are complicated things, my sparrow.~
@662  = ~I try not to think about it too much.~
@663  = ~<CHARNAME>, I begin to suspect you are purposely denying this bard a true answer.~
@664  = ~Whatever gave you that impression, my dear sparrow?~
@665  = ~I've said all I wish to on this particular subject.~
@666  = ~You answer first. What does power 'taste like' to you, Haer'Dalis?~
@667  = ~You are a frightful tease, my devious raven. Will you truly refuse to provide an answer? Forget not that this bard currently pens the story of your life, and mayhap 'twould be wise for you to tell it in your own words lest I be forced to quote my own imaginings instead.~
@668  = ~It's not as simple as saying I like it or I dislike it, Haer'Dalis.~
@669  = ~Don't threaten me, Haer'Dalis. This conversation is over.~
@670  = ~'Twas not my intention to offend, <CHARNAME>.~
@671  = ~More's the pity, <CHARNAME>, for I much enjoy the sound of your voice.~
@672  = ~Why? Because you fear the power at your disposal? Or because you fear how much you crave it?~
@673  = ~Enough! I won't be judged by you.~
@674  = ~Silly sparrow. I don't like to think about it because it gives me a headache.~
@675  = ~The former.~
@676  = ~The latter.~
@677  = ~Must it be one or the other?~
@678  = ~I fear nothing, Haer'Dalis, and you would be wise to remember that.~
@679  = ~'Twas not judgment this sparrow offered, but curiosity. Surely you have grown accustomed to my queries after all this time together.~
@680  = ~I have nothing more to say on this particular subject.~
@681  = ~My dearest <CHARNAME>, you need not be glib to cut short my inquiries. If you do not wish to speak further of it, you need only tell this humble bard and he will deftly turn the conversation elsewhere.~
@682  = ~Without arguing? Since when?~
@683  = ~Since... right now! And the statement expires the moment this conversation ends.~
@684  = ~Oh, certainly not. But if you will not give me a direct answer, what can I do but guess?~
@685  = ~You could try leaving things well enough alone, you know.~
@686  = ~Ah, such silly suggestions you make at times, dear one.~
@687  = ~Posture all you like, my hound, but this bard has traveled far and long, and I know well that all living beings fear something. But, perhaps it would be wise to conclude my questions for now, as you are rarely in a receptive humor when such ridiculous declarations begin parading from your lips.~
@688  = ~Ah, you have turned the tides on Haer'Dalis! As you wish. It should come as little surprise that this sparrow craves not power in any form. Much responsibility is oft piled upon those who wield the crown and scepter, and I have little love for such chains.~
@689  = ~But I will speak no more until you say your piece, my <CHARNAME>.~
@690  = ~I've said all I wish to on this subject.~
@691  = ~Aye, that I imagine it is. Clearly I await a complicated answer.~
@692  = ~Okay. Power tastes sweet in the morning, but has gone sour by midday, and sometimes it keeps me up at night with its inane ramblings, and--~
@693  = ~Sometimes power agrees with me, and sometimes it doesn't.~
@694  = ~Look, I try not to think about it too much.~
@695  = ~We really ought to define 'normal' once and for all one of these days.~
@696  = ~Have I ever told you how much I loathe when a wise person plays the fool?~
@697  = ~Don't mock me! I have no idea what power it is you think I possess!~
@698  = ~What power, precisely, are you referring to, Haer'Dalis?~
@699  = ~Aww, you called me wise. How kind of you!~
@700  = ~My raven, this is a foolish game, but you seem determined to have me speak plainly.~
@701  = ~Tsk, and now you use humor to change the subject! Cruel minx.~
@702  = ~Ah, then you revel in the thrill power brings to you. I suppose I ought not be surprised.~
@703  = ~Indeed, you shouldn't be. I've never hidden the pleasure I take in the strength my blood brings me.~
@704  = ~Don't make light of such things. The power I have has brought me a great deal of responsibility. I have no desire to abuse it.~
@705  = ~I wouldn't say I revel in it, but I certainly don't have anything to complain about.~
@706  = ~I've accomplished much and come far in my life. Shouldn't I find some joy in that?~
@707  = ~No, I do what I must to survive. There's not much satisfaction to be found in that.~
@708  = ~I tire of this subject, Haer'Dalis.~
@709  = ~Do not be so quick to give your blood all the credit. Clearly your father's legacy plays a great role in many events in your life, but 'tis *you* who accomplishes the feats and tasks laid before you.~
@710  = ~None? Not even a little?~
@711  = ~Absolutely not! Once a person starts down that road, when do they stop?~
@712  = ~I'm not saying the temptation isn't there, but I won't take the bait.~
@713  = ~Well... maybe a little.~
@714  = ~You want the truth? Everyday I think about abusing my power. Every hour, some obstacle gets in my way that could so easily be torn to pieces and gone for good. It's a constant, uphill battle for control.~
@715  = ~I see your point, but I doubt you have so little control that you would fall utterly under the spell of such temptations. You ought live a little, my raven, consequences be damned.~
@716  = ~Some bait is more tempting than others, my dear <CHARNAME>. I wonder if you will someday meet a sort you are unable to resist.~
@717  = ~Ah, good. This sparrow feared you'd gone and lost all sense for a moment there.~
@718  = ~I apologize, my raven, if I have soured your mood. I cannot, however, regret that I provoked such a response. This sparrow feels he understands you better than he did but a moment ago.~
@719  = ~There is always something to complain about, <CHARNAME>. I highly recommend that you revel in your victories on occasion. I daresay you have earned it.~
@720  = ~Aye, you should indeed, though not enough to become complacent, I should hope.~
@721  = ~I daresay that is a rather bleak and dishonest assessment of your current state of affairs, my hound. At the risk of repeating an already trite phrase, things could be much worse, by a drastic measure.~
@722  = ~Then you find it burdensome, do you?~
@723  = ~Very much so. I would give it all up to have a mediocre, mundane existence.~
@724  = ~I do what I must to survive. There's not much satisfaction to be found in that.~
@725  = ~I refuse to take such things lightly. The power I have has brought me a great deal of responsibility. I have no desire to abuse it.~
@726  = ~Perhaps, though I've accomplished much and come far in my life. Maybe I should find some joy in that.~
@727  = ~I wouldn't say it's a burden, but it certainly isn't something I celebrate either.~
@728  = ~You have truly learned the best ways to make this sparrow shudder in disgust, my dear. One can only hope you are never given the option to trade who you are now for some pale shadow of yourself.~
@729  = ~'Tis unfortunate. This sparrow muses that we could do with more opportunities to celebrate.~
@730  = ~I see.~
@731  = ~It seems likely that your power will only continue to grow as time goes on. There are moments when I wonder if there is a limit to it all. What happens when you reach the end of all things?~
@732  = ~You sound very far away and sad, Haer'Dalis. What are you really thinking?~
@733  = ~That philosophy of yours insists there is a limit to everything, yet you speak as if I could be the exception.~
@734  = ~I'd like to think my potential is limitless.~
@735  = ~I wonder the same thing.~
@736  = ~Such thoughts frighten me.~
@737  = ~Enough, Haer'Dalis. We cannot afford more delays.~
@738  = ~I... am thinking that perhaps I ought to thank you for denying my declaration of love. But I know I could never bring myself to be truly grateful for it. Not when my heart--~
@739  = ~That I will lose you, as all things are eventually lost. And that I fear who I will become once you are gone, because I--~
@740  = ~You have already proven yourself the exception of a great many truths. Should I arrogantly expect that my beliefs are somehow impervious to your dangerous influence? Would that it were that simple.~
@741  = ~As would we all, <CHARNAME>. As would we all.~
@742  = ~Such wonderings are likely unhealthy for the both of us, my dear. We ought find other distractions to keep us diverted, aye?~
@743  = ~Aye. They frighten me as well.~
@744  = ~As you say, <CHARNAME>.~
@745  = ~Hah! Ah, listen to this fool of a bard. Excuse my hasty exit, my raven. I will scout ahead.~
@746  = ~(Haer'Dalis drifts toward you on purposeless feet, his eyes downcast and his face creased by heavy bemusement. When he finally comes to a meandering stop, it is unclear if he realizes you are standing beside him.)~
@747  = ~(After a long pause and a barely audible sigh, the bard raises his head and reaches out to run his fingers down the length of one of the straps on your pack. His hand pauses only once to leave behind a single flower twisted around the frayed bit of cloth.)~
@748  = ~(Though the bloom is fair enough as flowers go, there is nothing particularly striking about this one. The few leaves that have not yet abandoned the withered stem are dry and drooping, and the petals are curling with age at the edges.)~
@749  = ~(Haer'Dalis seems still lost in his own thoughts because he does not meet your eyes, does not speak a word, and his troubled expression does not waver. He gives the flower a last glance and turns to walk away.)~
@750  = ~Thank you, my sparrow.~
@751  = ~Haer'Dalis, what's wrong?~
@752  = ~I prefer roses, you know.~
@753  = ~They die so quickly. Don't they?~
@754  = ~(Sigh and roll your eyes at his dramatic mood.)~
@755  = ~(Flick the dying flower off of your pack and continue on your way.)~
@756  = ~(The tiefling stiffens and goes very still. He does not turn back to look at you, and his voice is strangely cold when he speaks.)~
@757  = ~I have done nothing to earn your thanks.~
@758  = ~You gave me this pretty flower. Why shouldn't I thank you for it?~
@759  = ~Haer'Dalis, you have done a lot for me. Surely you know that.~
@760  = ~You've given me a reminder of the frailty and fleeting nature of life.~
@761  = ~Yet you have it all the same.~
@762  = ~I have no patience for your foul mood, Haer'Dalis.~
@763  = ~Because in an hour, perhaps two, all signs of life will have faded from that doomed bit of nature. 'Tis nothing but a reminder of the oft painful truth that entropy takes all in but the blink of an eye.~
@764  = ~I have done no more than the least of your companions, and far less than I ought at times. I am ill deserving of your favor, and this dying reminder of our impending doom should earn no gratitude. In the passing of mere moments, life is naught but dust.~
@765  = ~My... my raven, you make a far better Doomguard than I at times. 'Tis a reminder, aye, and a painful one. In the passing of mere moments, life is naught but dust.~
@766  = ~I am ill deserving of your favor, and this dying reminder of our impending doom should earn no gratitude. In the passing of mere moments, life is naught but dust.~
@767  = ~And I have none for yours.~
@768  = ~(He turns his head to flash you a perfectly polished smile.)~
@769  = ~Nothing, my dear raven. In fact, all is exactly as it should be.~
@770  = ~Don't put on an act for me, Haer'Dalis. Tell me what's on your mind.~
@771  = ~If you say so.~
@772  = ~Ah. Mood swings again.~
@773  = ~Enough of this. Let's go.~
@774  = ~Far too many ill and doomed thoughts for me to name in any reasonable span of time, my dear <CHARNAME>. All I have done is remind myself of truths already well known to me. The inevitable cannot be delayed o'erlong.~
@775  = ~I do!~
@776  = ~But, of course. 'Tis one of the few things we regularly have in common, is it not?~
@777  = ~As you would have it, my raven.~
@778  = ~Then you ought court a gardener, my hound.~
@779  = ~(The tiefling goes still and his shoulders slump. A nearly silent murmur of agreement is all he offers in reply.)~
@780  = ~Haer'Dalis, please tell me what's on your mind.~
@781  = ~(Embrace him.)~
@782  = ~I thought you celebrated such things.~
@783  = ~(The bard sighs into your hair and holds you painfully tight for a moment.)~
@784  = ~So quickly come, so quickly gone...~
@785  = ~(sigh) I do.~
@786  = ~(Haer'Dalis does not seem to notice.)~
@787  = ~(Haer'Dalis must have noticed your actions, because he chuckles a moment later, the sound cold and bitter, and avoids you for some time afterward.)~
@788  = ~And yet... if you would permit me...?~
@789  = ~(The bard reaches as if to take your hand, but hesitates.)~
@790  = ~(Offer him your hand.)~
@791  = ~(Wait and see what he does.)~
@792  = ~What are you doing?~
@793  = ~Enough of this, Haer'Dalis.~
@794  = ~(He takes hold of your wrist and patiently bares the skin on the back of your forearm. The tiefling thoughtfully brushes his fingers over the exposed flesh for a moment, his gaze rivetted on the simple, almost absent movement. After a pause, he begins to hum under his breath.)~
@795  = ~(Magic tingles your bare skin, and from beneath the tips of his fingers, a ghostly image begins to appear on your arm.)~
@796  = ~(Jerk your arm away from him in surprise.)~
@797  = ~(Watch silently.)~
@798  = ~(The bard's humming is cut short and whatever image was forming vanishes, leaving your skin exactly as it was before he began to weave the spell. Haer'Dalis quickly buries the pain that flares behind his dark eyes, then he offers you a stiff, formal bow and walks away.)~
@799  = ~Painting.~
@800  = ~(Pull your arm away from him.)~
@801  = ~Don't stop.~
@802  = ~(The tiefling glances at your face, then back to your unmoving limb before his expression hardens and his hands return to his sides.)~
@803  = ~This Doomguard has had enough of making a fool of himself.~
@804  = ~(Haer'Dalis closes the distance between you and lifts your hand in his.)~
@805  = ~(Wait for his next move.)~
@806  = ~Testing your trust? Or offering you a piece of myself? Perhaps a bit of both.~
@807  = ~(Let him continue.)~
@808  = ~Just a piece, hmm?~
@809  = ~A piece is all my heart can afford to offer you, <CHARNAME>.~
@810  = ~Another piece, aye. Bit by bit, perhaps you shall one day own the whole of me.~
@811  = ~(Haer'Dalis focuses on his task for several long moments, humming steadily under his breath as he works the spell over your skin. Painted upon the canvas of your bare flesh, an image resolves of the same flower the bard left twisted on your pack.)~
@812  = ~(It is little more than a simple outline at first, then the details begin to fill in until the picture presents a startlingly lifelike image. Unlike the dying flower, this one is free of imperfections, its petals flawless and hinting at a velvety softness that begs to be touched. Its spreading leaves and stem caress the curves of your forearm and curl around your wrist.)~
@813  = ~(Haer'Dalis continues to hold and stroke your arm, but he leans away to indicate he is finished, sighing quietly the last line of the song he has been humming.)~
@814  = ~(Stare in speechless wonder.)~
@815  = ~It's beautiful, Haer'Dalis.~
@816  = ~How long is that going to be there?~
@817  = ~Are you finished wasting our time?~
@818  = ~It suits you, my beautiful raven.~
@819  = ~(His dark eyes are soft with warm affection when he meets your gaze.)~
@820  = ~*You* are beautiful, my <CHARNAME>.~
@821  = ~It... it will vanish when I let go.~
@822  = ~Then don't let go.~
@823  = ~Is there a way to make it last longer?~
@824  = ~That's okay. It's beautiful now, and I'll carry the memory with me after it's gone.~
@825  = ~Perhaps I should get it permanently tattooed there.~
@826  = ~All that effort for nothing, then?~
@827  = ~If you're finished wasting our time, let's just go.~
@828  = ~(The bard stares longingly into your eyes for a drawn out moment. With great reluctance, he releases your hand and watches as the flower's image fades away.)~
@829  = ~Forgive me, my raven. I have no choice.~
@830  = ~(Haer'Dalis raises one hand to cradle your jaw, his smile bittersweet and painfully honest before he presses a gentle kiss to your lips.)~
@831  = ~Ah, my love. If only 'twere so simple.~
@832  = ~I could slow the fading of this spell for a while, if you wish, but in a fortnight it would still be naught but a memory. I cannot make it last for all time.~
@833  = ~Cannot? Or will not?~
@834  = ~I would like it to last as long as possible.~
@835  = ~(sigh) My raven...~
@836  = ~(He drops your arm and averts his eyes as the flower's image fades away.)~
@837  = ~I cannot change the way things are. Even if I could... No, even if I could, I would not. Forgive me.~
@838  = ~The spell takes but a moment...~
@839  = ~There. Now you shall carry a reminder of my affection for you for a while.~
@840  = ~Aye, my dear raven. Some things are destined to be in our memories for all time.~
@841  = ~If that is what you desire, I would certainly not protest. You are lovely either way.~
@842  = ~(Your words obviously pain the tiefling greatly, but he buries his feelings under a quick grin as he drops your hand and steps away from you.)~
@843  = ~Aye, my hound, 'twas indeed for nothing.~
@844  = ~(The bard drops your arm and the phantom image vanishes, leaving your skin exactly as it was before he began to weave the spell. Haer'Dalis' stare is cold, his emotions and thoughts hidden. After a momentary hesitation, he offers you a stiff, formal bow and walks away.)~
@845  = ~Come. I would enjoy this moment and hold your hand as long as circumstance permits us. And... thank you for this.~
@846  = ~Stop, my raven, I can bear it no longer! We must speak. I find myself at the end of my proverbial rope, no longer capable of holding this wild tongue of mine. The curtain draws closed! The director parts his lips and takes a breath in preparation to command, 'Exit, stage left!'~
@847  = ~Meaning what?~
@848  = ~Then let him speak the words, for I am long since ready for that moment!~
@849  = ~I've been waiting for this day...~
@850  = ~Haer'Dalis, I don't have time for one of your dramatic tantrums right now.~
@851  = ~Meaning, my darling, that I tire of this path we tread upon, this painfully straight and narrow track that drags or pushes us ever onward toward inevitability!~
@852  = ~Then you understand my frustration? How can you not be sick to death of this path we tread upon, this painfully straight and narrow track that drags or pushes us ever onward toward inevitability?~
@853  = ~I simply cannot--~
@854  = ~Whatever do you mean, <CHARNAME>?~
@855  = ~You're leaving, aren't you?~
@856  = ~You've finally gone stark raving mad, of course. It was inevitable.~
@857  = ~Nothing. What were you going on about?~
@858  = ~Just get to the damned point already, bard!~
@859  = ~Is that what you desire, my dear <CHARNAME>?~
@860  = ~Of course not! I just...~
@861  = ~I care about you, and I'd be devastated if you left.~
@862  = ~No, but I have no illusions that you'll be around forever. When your wanderlust calls you away, I will understand.~
@863  = ~It doesn't matter what I want. It matters what you want.~
@864  = ~Sometimes, Haer'Dalis. Sometimes.~
@865  = ~If I answer in the affirmative, will you go away?~
@866  = ~And yet, that has never been enough. Has it?~
@867  = ~I certainly hope that is mere exaggeration. You should not place such slight value on your desires, for they mean a great deal to me.~
@868  = ~Why does that not surprise me?~
@869  = ~No, likely not.~
@870  = ~My love, is that what you think of me? That this bard would simply crow a wild pronouncement and vanish into the night forevermore?~
@871  = ~I love you, my sparrow, and I'd be devastated if you left.~
@872  = ~Haer'Dalis, I've given you my heart, but I have no illusions that you and I will be together for a lifetime.~
@873  = ~That's not what I meant. Perhaps you should explain yourself.~
@874  = ~I think a fair number of unflattering things about you, my dear bard, and I'd be surprised if any of them were untrue.~
@875  = ~Yes, Haer'Dalis, that is what I think. You've given me no reason to think otherwise.~
@876  = ~Under normal circumstances, I might agree with that, but considering how often we find ourselves in mortal danger, perhaps one or more of our lifetimes will be shorter than we anticipate, aye?~
@877  = ~Ah, have I told you recently just how much I crave that razor-edged tongue of yours, my vicious raven?~
@878  = ~If that be true, and I am not certain that it is, then I am sorry I have not earned your trust by now.~
@879  = ~Let me be very clear, my friend. I have no desire whatsoever to be parted from your company at present. Either I've misspoken or you've misunderstood, but whatever the case may be, you have this sparrow tucked safely in your pocket. Have no doubt of that.~
@880  = ~What I really intended to say was...~
@881  = ~Let me be very clear, my love. I have no desire whatsoever to be parted from your company, and my affection for you has in no way waned since I first declared it in the depths of Hell. Either I've misspoken or you've misunderstood, but whatever the case may be, you have this sparrow wrapped around your finger and any other part of you that desires my touch. Have no doubt of that.~
@882  = ~I will not argue that there is some truth in your words, but I'll not let your inane sanity forestall the purpose of this petty speech.~
@883  = ~'Tis no tantrum, and I will not be ignored, my hound. How can you not be sick to death of this path we tread upon, this painfully straight and narrow track that drags or pushes us ever onward toward inevitability?~
@884  = ~This relentless destiny of yours, your power-starved siblings, accusations, lies, painful truths, treachery, prophecy, impending doom at every turn - truly, 'twould seem as if these events would keep a starved actor such as myself on his toes, but in truth I am sickened by the sheer predictability of it all!~
@885  = ~Predictable? You're calling all of this *predictable*?~
@886  = ~This is a trick, isn't it? Who are you, and what have you done with my Haer'Dalis?~
@887  = ~I would think this sort of life is a Doomguard's dream come true.~
@888  = ~Oh, you're just complaining for the sake of hearing your own voice, Haer'Dalis.~
@889  = ~And so... what? You're leaving?~
@890  = ~Can you just get to the point already?~
@891  = ~Not the specific events, certainly not, but the insanity of it all is painfully trite! Despite the probable paradox, 'tis possible that unpredictability itself is far too predictable in this case. Let us then leave it in the dust of yesterday!~
@892  = ~I am as Haer'Dalis as Haer'Dalis has ever been, my dearest. Mayhap 'tis you who are not as <CHARNAME> as <CHARNAME> has always been. All the more reason to put this behind us!~
@893  = ~Aye, as did I! But, though rare indeed, this sparrow has indeed been known to be wrong on occasion. This moment seems a fair enough example of that. All the more reason to put this behind us!~
@894  = ~Don't be silly, my raven. I've not done that since yesterday.~
@895  = ~Not I. We.~
@896  = ~Run away with me, <CHARNAME>. Take my hand, turn your back on this life, and walk with me toward a new tomorrow. I cannot swear it will be safe, and I cannot swear we will never part, but I promise you that as long as we are together, I will show you places you've never dreamed existed.~
@897  = ~What? No! I can't do that!~
@898  = ~(snort) Just so you can abandon me when you get bored? No thanks.~
@899  = ~I wish it were that easy, but we both know it isn't.~
@900  = ~I... I don't know what to say...~
@901  = ~Is that really what you want, Haer'Dalis, or are you just toying with me?~
@902  = ~Done. Let's get going.~
@903  = ~Really? Yes! Yes, of course I'll go with you.~
@904  = ~Why not? What reason could you possibly have to deny me this one request?~
@905  = ~You say that like you're asking for something simple, like a new pair of boots! This is my *life*, Haer'Dalis!~
@906  = ~I would love nothing more than to lose myself on the Planes with you, my sparrow, but I can't.~
@907  = ~I have unfinished business, and you know that. I cannot walk away, not now, not until I've seen things through.~
@908  = ~We both know damned well you're not really asking me to leave with you. This is some game of yours, and I'll not play it!~
@909  = ~There is power to be had on this path we walk. I would be a fool to run off with you before I've taken it for myself.~
@910  = ~Enough! This is not up for debate! Stop wasting our time!~
@911  = ~Has it ever occurred to you, oh wise raven of mine, that this sparrow might actually wish to see you *live* once in a while? That one who cares for you deeply, perhaps more than he ought, loathes the way this life has dragged and torn at your wild spirit, and wishes only to see you smile and dance and be truly, utterly *free*, even if only for a brief moment?~
@912  = ~You can't save me from this life, Haer'Dalis. No one can.~
@913  = ~I don't need you to rescue me!~
@914  = ~When this is over, I will be free. Until then, I have to keep moving forward.~
@915  = ~You have no idea how tempting that sounds.~
@916  = ~Then forget all this. Let's go. Right now, just like you said.~
@917  = ~I have to try, my <CHARNAME>, even should my attempts prove futile. 'Tis the least I can do.~
@918  = ~No? Oughtn't I try? You have saved me twice from certain doom, from steel bars and torture, from madness and futility, yet you command me now to ignore your prison bars and leave you to rot?~
@919  = ~Because until it is done, it will shadow your every step and slowly bind you in ever tighter chains until you suffocate under the weight of it. Aye, this sparrow understands.~
@920  = ~But not tempting enough, aye?~
@921  = ~Again I ask, why not? If 'tis truly the longing of your heart, then why ignore it?~
@922  = ~This bard knows very well that unfinished business has a habit of staying just out of reach, and even should it find its conclusion, there will always be more business waiting on the horizon.~
@923  = ~There are a great many things to be found on this path of yours, my hound, and not all are as pleasant as that power you so crave.~
@924  = ~Who's to say it shall be I who grows bored with you and not the other way 'round?~
@925  = ~All told, does it really matter? I ask this of you right here, right now, with all the passion and conviction I am capable of, and what reason could you possibly conjure up to deny me?~
@926  = ~Truly? Just like that? All I had to do was ask, and you are prepared to leave it all behind on the whim of a mad Doomguard?~
@927  = ~Yes. I trust you, Haer'Dalis, come good or ill.~
@928  = ~Honestly, I've been thinking about walking away for a while now.~
@929  = ~I knew it! You're toying with me!~
@930  = ~If this was a joke, it was a rather cruel one...~
@931  = ~No, I just wanted to see the look on your face if I agreed.~
@932  = ~I wish it were within my power to assure you that I will never abuse such freely given trust, <CHARNAME>, but I would only make a liar out of me given enough time. Your honesty humbles me.~
@933  = ~And you said not a word to this poor bard? We could have been planning our escape for days now! Why, we could be halfway to Sigil, blissfully drunk in a carriage drawn by a pair of angry vrocks! If only you'd told me of your desires.~
@934  = ~No, 'twas no wicked game I whispered in your ear, but true longing and honest desire. Your reply caught me off guard, but I ought to be accustomed to your habit of disarming me by now, aye?~
@935  = ~And this bard finds himself playing the role of fool once more. Well done, my hound.~
@936  = ~Soon, my raven, we shall fly the confines of this life. One way or another. I swear it.~
@937  = ~I had to ask. I had to *know*. I had to see these emotions written upon your face and hear the inflection of your voice, for these things tell me far more than words alone.~
@938  = ~So, you were testing me?~
@939  = ~I don't like being prodded for a response like some wizard's test subject, Haer'Dalis.~
@940  = ~You played on my emotions because you're afraid I'm not being honest with you?~
@941  = ~What would you have done if I'd agreed to run off with you?~
@942  = ~Are you finished with your stupid little game?~
@943  = ~Perhaps I was. Perhaps some small, foolish part of this bard's restless heart still clings to hope that you will come to love me as I love you, though the time for such sentiment and confession has long since passed.~
@944  = ~'Tis no easy thing, you know, loving a Bhaalspawn. Even this fiendling, for all his watchful eye and perceptive insights, struggles to comprehend your desires and know the truth in your heart.~
@945  = ~I apologize if I've offended, my friend, for 'twas not my intention. Perhaps some small, foolish part of this bard's restless heart still clings to hope that you will come to love me as I love you, though the time for such sentiment and confession has long since passed.~
@946  = ~Forgive this sparrow, my love, but surely you must understand that 'tis no easy thing to love a Bhaalspawn. Even this fiendling, for all his watchful eye and perceptive insights, struggles to comprehend your desires and know the truth in your heart.~
@947  = ~Would it surprise you to hear that I have often hoped you have indeed been dishonest with me? Some small, foolish part of this bard's restless heart still clings to hope that you will come to love me as I love you, though the time for such sentiment and confession has long since passed.~
@948  = ~My beloved raven, if I fear anything at all, it is that you've been completely and utterly honest with me in all ways. Aye, that frightens me beyond all measure.~
@949  = ~I... I do not know. I would certainly have wondered why you'd leave your life behind to chase the whims of a man you claim to see only as a friend, but mayhap that is the foolish romantic in me speaking. In all likelihood, I'd have changed the subject and fled with my tail betwixt my legs!~
@950  = ~I cannot decide if I'd have done something entirely lewd and inappropriate to you right here where we stand, or if I'd have changed the subject in a panic and run off with my tail betwixt my legs!~
@951  = ~No, but I shall continue to observe in silence if that pleases you.~
@952  = ~I wish we could have been more to one another, my raven. Mayhap this story will weave itself very differently in another lifetime.~
@953  = ~I love you, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps I should tell you that more often, more directly, more freely, but I hope you never doubt the truth of it. No matter what comes.~
@954  = ~I have a gift for you, my dearest <CHARNAME>. Will you sit a moment with me?~
@955  = ~Of course.~
@956  = ~Oh, a present! Yay! What is it?~
@957  = ~For a man bearing gifts, you seem awfully pensive.~
@958  = ~Make it quick.~
@959  = ~Time has passed so quickly, and yet it feels I have known you for far longer than this brief span of time. Never could I have anticipated the direction our tales have turned. Do you recall how this courtship of ours first began?~
@960  = ~Yes, you wanted to write about my life, as I recall.~
@961  = ~You used to ask me questions, dozens of them at once! You'd pick apart every word I said to try to learn everything you possibly could about me.~
@962  = ~It does feel like a long time ago. With all that's happened, I barely remember it.~
@963  = ~Uh, I don't. Is that bad?~
@964  = ~Yes, yes, when do we get to the part where you give me your gift?~
@965  = ~Aye, that I did. And that I have.~
@966  = ~You were quite the mystery to me then. Strange. Usually when my knowledge of someone reaches a certain point, I grow bored with them. With you, I feel there is always something new to discover. I cannot help but wonder how long my fascination would last, if given endless time to explore it.~
@967  = ~That does not surprise this sparrow, for even I have difficulty recalling things we have done and places we have been. Too much, too quickly, perhaps? There was a time when I thought such a thing was not possible.~
@968  = ~No, my raven. A half-goddess you may be, but you are still mortal and subject to all of its sweet frailties.~
@969  = ~Ah, my raven, you are nothing if not predictable. But bear with me, please.~
@970  = ~Hah! Your eagerness is adorable, and warms this sparrow's heart.~
@971  = ~Pensive? Aye, perhaps I am. This is important to me. Important to *us*.~
@972  = ~This romance of ours began with an urge. The urge to write. *My* urge to write. About you, about your life, about your needs and wants and desires.~
@973  = ~Asking you to share your past with me, it was the beginning of something I did not yet understand, something greater than I have experienced in a long time. Perhaps greater than anything I've been part of, even. I do not speak those words with an actor's tongue. I truly find myself in awe of what I have seen and done in your fair company.~
@974  = ~I feel the same way, Haer'Dalis.~
@975  = ~To be honest, I thought your whole idea of writing about me was just a line. I never expected you to actually write anything.~
@976  = ~That's high praise, coming from someone like you.~
@977  = ~This sounds like a good-bye. You're not leaving, are you?~
@978  = ~The point, bard, get to the point!~
@979  = ~Ah. Well. As much as it pains me to admit, your assertion is not without merit. I was intrigued by you, that much was always true, but I also did not expect anything more than talk to come from our interactions.~
@980  = ~I was wrong.~
@981  = ~No, I meant it not as praise. You are not some entertainer to keep me happy and occupied for a brief stretch of time whilst life rushes by and I wait for something better to wander past. I am awed because you allowed me to be part of it, not because it happened in the first place.~
@982  = ~That is not my intention, no.~
@983  = ~Here.~
@984  = ~(The bard slips a thick, leather-bound book into your hands. Though slightly worn from use, the expensive cover is intricately designed with an inlay of flowers and vines, and the pages inside are made of fine, expensive parchment, nearly all of them covered in Haer'Dalis' surprisingly tidy handwriting.)~
@985  = ~Your story, my raven, from the very beginning, written by the hand of your humble sparrow. Everything you've told me, and a fair number of things you haven't, rests within these pages. Every moment of frustration, every terrifying battle, every smile...~
@986  = ~The first time I saw your face.~
@987  = ~The first time I heard your voice.~
@988  = ~The first time I tasted your lips.~
@989  = ~The first time we made love.~
@990  = ~The first time I watched you walk away from me and into the arms of another lover.~
@991  = ~All of it is contained within. I wanted to wait to give it to you until this current adventure had reached its conclusion, but...~
@992  = ~You wrote about our bedroom antics?~
@993  = ~Afraid we won't live that long?~
@994  = ~But...?~
@995  = ~Haer'Dalis, this is such an amazing gift.~
@996  = ~I don't know if I like the idea of all this information floating around.~
@997  = ~Are you insane?! How could you possibly think it's a good idea to write down everything I've ever done?!~
@998  = ~This is all you have for me?~
@999  = ~And why not? You never took our affair to heart, so why would you be concerned that I chronicled our enjoyable escapades? You can take those pages out and destroy them if they disturb you.~
@1000 = ~'Tis a real possibility, my dear. Even more so these days.~
@1001 = ~I am glad it meets your approval, and I hope it brings you joy to peruse its pages and recall glimpses of your past and scenes of our time together.~
@1002 = ~You'd best keep it safe from prying eyes, then. Or burn it. Whatever pleases you, my hound.~
@1003 = ~Aye, but that is not all I have to say.~
@1004 = ~I long ago confessed my love for you and was met with a kind but painful rebuff. As is oft true of unrequited love, this sparrow did believe his passion for you would never fade or dim. In some moments, I felt I was destined to play the sorrowful role of the unwanted suitor for all of my days. Entropy has proved me a fool once again.~
@1005 = ~You're not in love with me anymore?~
@1006 = ~Well, you sure got over me quickly.~
@1007 = ~It's about damned time you stopped pining over me.~
@1008 = ~What? But... Haer'Dalis, I have feelings for you.~
@1009 = ~No! Don't say that! I love you, I *have* loved you for a while, I just didn't have the courage to say anything!~
@1010 = ~That is not what I said.~
@1011 = ~It does not feel so to this sparrow, I assure you.~
@1012 = ~Aye, you have not always made my agony easy to bear, and so I too find it pleasing to shake free of the burden.~
@1013 = ~And I for you, my dear, but 'tis not enough. I see that now. Whatever might have been is naught but ash in the wind.~
@1014 = ~Do not speak so, my raven, for it breaks this poor sparrow's heart! I cannot allow myself to believe you are sincere, not now, not after all this time has passed. Forgive me.~
@1015 = ~I have no thoughts of leaving your side, and this bard holds no bitterness toward you, my raven, but my heart is my own once more. 'Tis but the way of all things, to fade and die and make way for the new. Mayhap I ought to thank you. This lesson in entropy caught me by surprise, but 'twas clearly a much needed reminder of the truths I've long known.~
@1016 = ~I never meant to hurt you, you know.~
@1017 = ~I wish I could have loved you the way you wanted me to.~
@1018 = ~This is for the best.~
@1019 = ~We're still friends, right?~
@1020 = ~I... I can't believe this is happening...~
@1021 = ~Oh, wonderful. And you'd been so good about keeping your Doomguard rubbish to yourself lately.~
@1022 = ~Aye, this sparrow knows, my dearest <CHARNAME>. Resentment never took root in my heart, and our companionship remains untainted by dark emotion. You mean much to me, my friend.~
@1023 = ~I... Is it strange that I wish you had not uttered those words? 'Tis more painful than it ought to be. No, my raven, love 'twas clearly not made for the pair of us, but you shall always be my dear friend.~
@1024 = ~Mayhap it is. Glad I am to have your company and friendship, my raven.~
@1025 = ~Of course! Never have doubt of that, my dear. Regardless of what may come, this sparrow will gladly leap into the fray for you.~
@1026 = ~Please, my raven, do not look upon me so. You are dear to me, and I shall ever be your friend and companion no matter what this way comes.~
@1027 = ~I have? Well, I shall certainly have to correct that mistake! Thank you, my dear friend. Sincerely.~
@1028 = ~'Tis my hope that you and I might find time betwixt the battles and travel to fill these last pages of your book with a suitable conclusion for this soon-ended portion of your life. Or perhaps you wish to write the words yourself. That I would understand.~
@1029 = ~Regardless, this sparrow has been honored to know you. I will remember our time together with fondness and affection until my dying breath, <CHARNAME>.~
@1030 = ~Aye, and I have oft imagined what 'twould be like to hear you recite such passages aloud...~
@1031 = ~This book contains all I know of you, and it belongs in your hands. I am ill prepared to present it to you so soon, but still...~
@1032 = ~'Tis all but a certainty, my love, but that is not my motivation, no.~
@1033 = ~My love, this labor proved to be as much a gift to the sparrow as it was to the raven. It pleases me that it pleases you.~
@1034 = ~'Tis better that I give it to you now. You see, these last pages of the book were left empty for a purpose. Surely I need not point out that your tale has not yet reached its dramatic conclusion, my raven.~
@1035 = ~But alas that it is not this sparrow's place to play a leading role in these events yet to come. A good hound has stolen your affections from me, or mayhap your affections always rested with him and I was but a footnote, but the result is the same regardless of the truth.~
@1036 = ~Your heart belongs to Anomen, just as Anomen in turn loves you. And while truly this poor bard loves you also, I know well that I cannot be for you what he can. I am a man without a future, for I look only as far as today and the delight each moment brings. 'Twould be the ultimate act of selfishness to keep you for myself. And so, I set you free, my dearest raven. Because you, above all other birds, should never be caged.~
@1037 = ~You're ending our relationship?~
@1038 = ~Wh-what? You can't just...! But...~
@1039 = ~Are you daft? I love *you*, not *Anomen*!~
@1040 = ~After all we've been through, you're just going to leave me?~
@1041 = ~This might not be the best thing to say, but I feel relieved. It's been hard loving you both.~
@1042 = ~Don't talk about me like I'm some belonging you can hand over to another man! You don't get to make my choices for me!~
@1043 = ~I must do this, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis one of the hardest choices I've ever faced, but in truth the choice was not made by me. 'Twas made by you, by your actions... or inaction, and I am only doing all I can to honor that choice.~
@1044 = ~If you love him not, then you are a truly gifted actress, for you have not only fooled the poor hound, but you have convincingly deceived this sparrow as well. Even so, this choice has been made. 'Tis done, my raven.~
@1045 = ~No, I will not leave your side unless you command me away, or death herself takes me. But we cannot continue as we are now. You knew this would not last, and that an end was fast approaching.~
@1046 = ~I know, my love. Perhaps I ought not to have waited so long for this moment, but letting you slip into the embrace of a man such as Anomen... 'Twas no easy thing, letting you go.~
@1047 = ~In that you are correct, my dear hound, for this choice was yours and yours alone. 'Twas not this sparrow's desire to see your affections split betwixt myself and Anomen, of that I can assure you. What I do now is a result of your actions, not a conscious choice of my own.~
@1048 = ~I love you, <CHARNAME>, and it seems likely that I will continue to love you until entropy sees fit to catch this sparrow up in her dark embrace. When our paths have long since diverged and I find my drifting thoughts have turned to you, perhaps I shall take some comfort in the knowledge that you are safely in the arms of your good hound, content in the life you've forged for yourself.~
@1049 = ~This is not over! *We* are not over! I refuse to let you go!~
@1050 = ~(sob) Please, my sparrow... please don't...~
@1051 = ~I can't believe you're letting me go without a fight.~
@1052 = ~You deserve better than this, Haer'Dalis. I'm so sorry.~
@1053 = ~I guess that's all there is to say, then.~
@1054 = ~Get away from me. GET. AWAY! I never want to see you again, you... you *fraud*! Coward! LEAVE!~
@1055 = ~Then you will only harm yourself and damage further the love you have with Anomen. Do not be a fool. Calm yourself!~
@1056 = ~Yours is not a face made for tears, but for smiles and winks and laughter. Dry your eyes, my dearest raven. This sparrow is the first to tell you that he is not worth all of that.~
@1057 = ~Perhaps you find these words unfair, but you are not a woman who needs a man to fight for her. You have faced nearly every manner of foe available and only come out stronger for it, yet you would have me think you some damsel in need of rescue? No, my dear. You were not born to play such a role.~
@1058 = ~Glad I am that you think so, my dear <CHARNAME>, but 'tisn't true. Life is not about what we deserve or what is fair. We both know that.~
@1059 = ~Aye.~
@1060 = ~I... My raven, I never--~
@1061 = ~Perhaps that is for the best. Perhaps that would be easier for the both of us...~
@1062 = ~Farewell, raven of my heart.~
@1063 = ~But alas that it is not this sparrow's place to play a leading role in these events yet to come. A certain hound has stolen your affections from me, or mayhap your affections always rested with him and I was but a footnote, but the result is the same regardless of the truth.~
@1064 = ~Your heart belongs to Gavin, just as Gavin in turn loves you. And while truly this poor bard loves you also, I know well that I cannot be for you what he can. I am a man without a future, for I look only as far as today and the delight each moment brings. 'Twould be the ultimate act of selfishness to keep you for myself.

I am a man without a future, for I look only as far as today and the delight each moment brings. 'Twould be the ultimate act of selfishness to keep you for myself. And so, I set you free, my dearest raven. Because you, above all other birds, should never be caged.~
@1200 = ~Are you daft? I love *you*, not *Solaufein*!~
@1201 = ~If you love him not, then you are a truly gifted actress, for you have not only fooled the poor gyrfalcon, but you have convincingly deceived this sparrow as well. Even so, this choice has been made. 'Tis done, my raven.~
@1202 = ~I know, my love. Perhaps I ought not to have waited so long for this moment, but I did not wish to admit aloud that your heart rested in Solaufein's hands and not my own. 'Twas no easy thing, letting you go.~
@1203 = ~In that you are correct, my dear hound, for this choice was yours and yours alone. 'Twas not this sparrow's desire to see your affections split betwixt myself and Solaufein, of that I can assure you. What I do now is a result of your actions, not a conscious choice of my own.~
@1204 = ~Then you will only harm yourself and damage further the love you have with Solaufein. Do not be a fool. Calm yourself!~
@1205 = ~Take my words on these frail pages, carry them with you, and let them be a reminder of beauty, passion, pain, and power that ought to never be forgotten. Sit with the one who loves you and finish these last pages together. Write an end to this chapter of your life by writing the first lines of the next.~
@1206 = ~'Tis my desire that we write these last lines together as we travel toward that unavoidable climactic moment awaiting us on the horizon. Let us spend our nights curled close to the fire, musing on the events of the day. Mayhap in the act of writing the end of this chapter of your life, we may also end up writing the first lines of the next.~
@1207 = ~I would love that! Thank you so much, my sparrow.~
@1208 = ~That sounds nice, Haer'Dalis.~
@1209 = ~If we survive that long.~
@1210 = ~I think I'm more comfortable with you handling the writing, honestly.~
@1211 = ~You're not writing another word about me in here, and I'm tossing this thing into the bottom of the first lake we see! Gods, have you no idea the danger this could put me in?!~
@1212 = ~Okay, okay, enough sentiment. Let's get back to work.~
@1213 = ~You are ever so welcome, my love.~
@1214 = ~Glad I am that we are in agreement, my love. Aye, very glad indeed.~
@1215 = ~Tsk, 'tis the sparrow's purpose to spout such declarations, not the raven's! Entropy has many times tried to take us before. I say let her try again and again. I do not fear her.~
@1216 = ~If you insist, but that does not forbid you from assisting this sparrow in his writing. It pleases me that you trust me to do your story justice, my love.~
@1217 = ~(sigh) You ever underestimate your own skills, but it pleases me that you trust me to do your story justice, my love.~
@1218 = ~You may be overreacting just a touch, my dear hound. It wounds this sparrow that you would so lightly toss aside an item I worked tirelessly to create for you, but do as you will.~
@1219 = ~I keep another copy where you shall never find it.~
@1220 = ~Aye, as you wish, my stoic raven.~
@1221 = ~Ah, my love. The strangest thought occurred to me yestereve and I... I've not been...~
@1222 = ~You're speechless? This must be serious indeed!~
@1223 = ~Haer'Dalis, it's okay. Calm down and tell me what's wrong.~
@1224 = ~Strange thoughts occur to you constantly. How is this one different?~
@1225 = ~(sigh) Not more melodrama...~
@1226 = ~We don't have time for this.~
@1227 = ~Aye, it is. I do not know if you will understand, but...~
@1228 = ~Aye. Of course.~
@1229 = ~Because it is a knife in the heart of this frail sparrow.~
@1230 = ~Please, be patient with me.~
@1231 = ~We have spoken of my fair Sigil, have we not? The City of Doors, my coveted Cage, the only one to which I always return...~
@1232 = ~Perhaps I have also mentioned that every sort of creature is welcome within the city, with only one exception.~
@1233 = ~Gods, my raven, are forbidden to enter.~
@1234 = ~Okay...?~
@1235 = ~Why does that upset you?~
@1236 = ~Ah, I think I see where this is going.~
@1237 = ~What about half-gods?~
@1238 = ~And why should I care about who can and cannot enter Sigil?~
@1239 = ~I know not if the Lady's decree applies to the children of deities as well, but I have never heard it said that anyone with the blood of a god stepped foot into Her city.~
@1240 = ~'Tis safe to assume you can never enter Sigil, my raven. Likely you would be killed for even making the attempt.~
@1241 = ~That's awful. I dreamed of one day walking through the streets of your home.~
@1242 = ~Hah, just let them try to stop me!~
@1243 = ~You said you don't know for sure, though. Maybe you're wrong.~
@1244 = ~Haer'Dalis, if I've said something to make you think otherwise then I'm sorry, but I have never had any intention of visiting Sigil.~
@1245 = ~Like I'd ever visit the crazy gutter you crawled out of? Not gonna happen.~
@1246 = ~*This* is what's bothering you?! Perhaps you should spend less time daydreaming about useless tripe and focus on what we're doing right now instead!~
@1247 = ~You see why I am troubled, aye?~
@1248 = ~Am I a fool if I tell you that you ought to care because *I* care?~
@1249 = ~Aye, 'tis a lovely dream. It strikes me as unequivocally tragic that my two fondest desires should be doomed to forever remain separate.~
@1250 = ~I would not allow you to try! I... Rather, I hope you would have the sense not to. Perhaps you would understand my insistence had you seen the Lady of Pain for yourself.~
@1251 = ~I can only hope someday I discover that I am, my love.~
@1252 = ~Mayhap that be true, but that is not the point.~
@1253 = ~I shall ignore your worthless spite, because you have missed the point entirely.~
@1254 = ~My hound, I am as focused as I have ever been, and these are not daydreams. You clearly do not understand my meaning.~
@1255 = ~'Tis a strange thing. If I am honest, I never truly imagined or hoped that one day we would walk hand-in-hand through the Bird Cage. 'Twould be a delight should such an occasion come to pass, but the future is not written. It cannot be planned. Who am I to know if we will survive to see another sunrise?~
@1256 = ~And yet... This sudden notion that has taken root in my mind that tells me it *cannot* happen... that it is a possibility *barred* from us...?~
@1257 = ~It burns me, my raven, far more than any other forbidden path ever has. I have never before resented your heritage, but in this moment, I would do anything to see you free of its influence.~
@1258 = ~I'm sure if we put our heads together we can come up with some way to sneak me inside.~
@1259 = ~Haer'Dalis, you're being silly.~
@1260 = ~So, you're not upset that the woman you love is forbidden to enter the city you love? You're upset because you imagine you've been cheated out of having some choice that probably wouldn't have happened anyway? That's like a child throwing a tantrum over a toy he didn't get that he's not even sure exists!~
@1261 = ~Are you trying to tell me that you'd leave me behind if you found a way to return to Sigil?~
@1262 = ~I want you to know that I don't expect you to be at my side forever. I would never try to hold you back from returning to the city you love so much.~
@1263 = ~Get over it. Quickly. We have more important things to worry about.~
@1264 = ~No, you do not understand. There is no *sneaking* into Sigil. The Lady would know, and if she did not grant you the mercy of a quick death, then you would find yourself rotting in one of her mazes with nothing but your own madness for company. This sparrow is not one to run from risk, but that is one venture in which I would have no part.~
@1265 = ~I know. And mayhap, by this time tomorrow, I'll have forgotten all about this absurd conversation!~
@1266 = ~Well... When you put it that way, it does seem rather selfish, but... Tsk, this is why I so rarely speak honestly. You simply do not understand me.~
@1267 = ~Would that surprise you?~
@1268 = ~Surprise? No. But I would be hurt.~
@1269 = ~No, I'd just like to know what to expect.~
@1270 = ~I don't know. I suppose I couldn't know for sure unless we were in that situation.~
@1271 = ~Well, yes! I thought I meant more to you than that.~
@1272 = ~Don't you dare dodge the question!~
@1273 = ~Never mind. I just realized I don't want to know the answer.~
@1274 = ~My raven, how easy it would be for this sparrow to lie like many other men and assure you that he will never do you harm, but we are neither of us foolish enough to believe such nonsensical platitudes.~
@1275 = ~And you think I have the answers?~
@1276 = ~Aye, that is the truth of it for us both.~
@1277 = ~And I thought you knew me better than that.~
@1278 = ~I have no intention of avoiding the answer. I simply wished to gain a better understanding of your reasons for asking such a question in the first place.~
@1279 = ~The truth is, I have no answer for such a query. There are infinite possibilities that might influence my decision, and how can even half of them be accounted for in some inane guessing game? I cannot reassure you in this, and you have no reason to believe me, but I am sorry for it. You are a woman deserving of a real answer. Alas that I am a man who has none.~
@1280 = ~You cannot know how much those words mean to me, but let me reassure you in return. I have no pressing desire to be parted from you, my dearest <CHARNAME>, not even for the promise of Sigil's embrace. And should our paths diverge, it will remain my secret hope that we be reunited one day.~
@1281 = ~I love you, <CHARNAME>, and as I have reconfirmed time and time again, I know not what tomorrow holds for any of us. If I were a better Doomguard, mayhap these thoughts would never have sprang to life in my mind to begin with. 'Tis difficult to consider that your company and our travels may have affected me so...~
@1282 = ~(sigh) And 'tis equally likely that this is naught but a wave of ill humor that will pass presently and leave me no worse off than I was before we met.~
@1283 = ~Would it really be so terrible if you let go of some of your Doomguard ways?~
@1284 = ~I love you because of who you are, not in spite of it. I've never wanted you to change, Haer'Dalis.~
@1285 = ~Hah! Because I'm such a terrible influence, right?~
@1286 = ~We all have moments like this. It's not the end of the world.~
@1287 = ~Would a kiss help take your mind off all this?~
@1288 = ~Let's hope so. Are we done here?~
@1289 = ~Hah! Clearly you think 'twould not be a grave loss, but it has taken this sparrow decades upon decades to achieve this strange form of peace with the reality of the multiverse. I have no desire to return to those best-forgotten days of doubt and fear.~
@1290 = ~I cannot swear I will never change, for that comes whether we will it or not. Just as you will inevitably face choices that will shape the woman you are now into someone else entirely, so too shall this sparrow be molded by the hands of time and entropy.~
@1291 = ~Oh, but you are indeed! Your eyes haunt my resting hours, and your lips tempt this bard at the worst possible moments. Oh, aye, you are the worst of all influences, for you are one I shall never wish to do without.~
@1292 = ~No, I suppose that is still a fair distance into the future, isn't it? A pity.~
@1293 = ~(His answer is a surprised and tender smile that crinkles the corners of his impossibly dark eyes. Murmuring a few words of confirmation, the bard sweeps you into a dramatic embrace, spinning you to one side and dipping you backward before his mouth descends to lay a soft, almost chaste kiss against your waiting lips. He sighs softly as he pulls away, and the unsettled look in his eyes has been replaced with affection and contentment.)~
@1294 = ~I will never cease to marvel at how you can so deftly turn this sparrow's thoughts to sweeter matters with nothing but a simple kiss.~
@1295 = ~Should I live long enough, I know my feet will carry me to my beloved Sigil once again. But I am a fool to spare a thought to that possibility when here stands at my side a beautiful woman with whom I am utterly enraptured. One would think that was the sort of lesson I'd have learned fifty years ago.~
@1296 = ~Tomorrow can wait, my love, for today waits for no one. Sigil can be my tomorrow. <CHARNAME> is my today.~
