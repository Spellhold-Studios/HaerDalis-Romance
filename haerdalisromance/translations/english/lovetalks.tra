@0    = ~Forgive this sparrow's stares, my raven, but there is something about you, something I cannot place. Indulge my curiosity for a moment, if you would.~
@1    = ~I'm not sure I know what you mean.~
@2    = ~You can sense that? I suppose that shouldn't surprise me.~
@3    = ~There is more than 'something' about me. I'm charming, beautiful, powerful. You have a great many reasons to stare, I dare say.~
@4    = ~Oh, no! I'm not falling for the whole 'charming, handsome bard' bit! Keep your flattery to yourself, *actor*!~
@5    = ~And humble and demure as well. Clearly you are burdened with more assets than any other creature I've encountered before now. 'Tis a wonder you can walk upright!~
@6    = ~It's not easy, that much is certain, but I manage somehow.~
@7    = ~I was just teasing. What were you saying?~
@8    = ~Can you just get to the point, bard?~
@9    = ~Surely it is your profound strength which enables you to endure.~
@10   = ~Such accusations in your eyes! Though knowing you find me charming and handsome lessens the sting by some degree. Mayhap you've had poor encounters with persons of my profession in the past, but I vow that my curiosity shall not cause you harm.~
@11   = ~Well... okay. But I have my eye on you!~
@12   = ~Very well, Haer'Dalis. Now, what were you saying?~
@13   = ~I would not have it any other way, my raven. Ah, but I digress.~
@14   = ~There is an aura of sorts that hangs over you. It swirls about you in wisps and shadows, tugs at the edge of my awareness with little, clawed fingers. A mortal <PRO_RACE> you may appear to be on the surface, but you are also something else, are you not?~
@15   = ~I suppose you could say that.~
@16   = ~If I were 'something else,' would that bother you?~
@17   = ~I am <CHARNAME>. That is all that matters.~
@18   = ~Surely you've heard the rumors about me.~
@19   = ~I'm a Child of Bhaal, Haer'Dalis. The daughter of the dead God of Murder.~
@20   = ~Keep your damned questions to yourself, bard.~
@21   = ~Hah! I am a planewalker, my raven. Ah, the things I have seen in my travels - beauty that would make you weep, terror that would stop your heart. No, I cannot imagine any answer you provide would bother me, as you say. On the contrary, I suspect I shall find your answer quite intriguing.~
@22   = ~Rumors never tell the whole story and oft favor one truth at the expense of another. I would much rather hear such a tale straight from the raven's beak, as it were.~
@23   = ~Come, share with me your dark secret! Or do you intend to keep this poor bard suffering in suspense for all time?~
@24   = ~I don't know what you're talking about!~
@25   = ~I am a Child of Bhaal, Haer'Dalis. The daughter of the dead God of Murder.~
@26   = ~The blood of an evil god flows in my veins. I am a Bhaalspawn.~
@27   = ~You do not trust this humble sparrow with the truth? I know we have not known each other overlong, but surely you do not believe I mean you harm. I owe you my freedom, after all.~
@28   = ~I suppose there's no harm in telling you. I am a Child of Bhaal, Haer'Dalis, a daughter of the dead God of Murder.~
@29   = ~If you must know, the blood of an evil god flows in my veins. I am a Bhaalspawn.~
@30   = ~I'm sorry, but I hardly know you. Maybe ask me some other time.~
@31   = ~I don't trust anyone, Haer'Dalis. It's the reason I'm still alive.~
@32   = ~Enough! I have no desire to speak to you, so just leave me be!~
@33   = ~As you would have it. This sparrow retreats... for now.~
@34   = ~There is a great burden upon you, <CHARNAME>. If ever you wish to speak of it, you have my ear. All you need do is ask.~
@35   = ~I appreciate that. Perhaps I will take you up on that offer someday.~
@36   = ~Um... okay. Thanks, I guess.~
@37   = ~I hope that you shall.~
@38   = ~You are most welcome.~
@39   = ~Ah, so the rumors are true then. I must say, you aren't nearly as tall, terrifying and fire-eyed as the stories claim of you. Your exploits abroad are rather infamous, or so I've gleaned from various little birdies. How delightfully fascinating that I find myself in your company.~
@40   = ~I cannot seem to escape the gossipmongers.~
@41   = ~If you already knew, then why ask me?~
@42   = ~Tell me more about these 'little birdies.'~
@43   = ~Just what in the hells makes you think it's okay for you to go nosing around in my life behind my back?~
@44   = ~W-what's so fascinating about it?~
@45   = ~Whatever you've heard doesn't matter. I'm still <CHARNAME>. I am my own person, Bhaal's blood be damned.~
@46   = ~I don't want to talk about this anymore.~
@47   = ~Surely you cannot blame them for their loose lips. From what I have seen of these lands, excitement and intrigue are rarities at times, and yet they flow abundantly in your wake. 'Tis only natural that you should draw the attention of lesser creatures.~
@48   = ~'Tis always best to seek the source. Relying on rumor and speculation is all well and good when the truth cannot be taken from its source, but I am fortunate enough to have the truth right before my eyes.~
@49   = ~And why do you desire this information?~
@50   = ~So I can feed them lies to mislead my enemies, of course.~
@51   = ~Because I'm going to silence them. Permanently.~
@52   = ~No reason.~
@53   = ~I don't really want to talk about this anymore.~
@54   = ~Ah, a wise tactic. I, however, prefer to keep my sources untainted. Surely you can see the wisdom in this approach as well.~
@55   = ~Ah, my timid raven, do you truly not recognize your own worth?~
@56   = ~Of course I do. And I'm not timid!~
@57   = ~I just don't understand why *you* find me fascinating.~
@58   = ~Worth?~
@59   = ~I-I... Haer'Dalis, would you please just get to the point?~
@60   = ~Hah, your moods unbalance this poor sparrow! How many women are in that lovely head of yours, I wonder.~
@61   = ~Don't you, though? Well, perhaps someday you will discover the answer.~
@62   = ~Confusion is a becoming look for you, dear raven. I have to wonder if you are truly so innocent or if your acting skills are on par with my own. No, do not answer! I am determined to discover the truth on my own.~
@63   = ~Perhaps, but it cannot mean *nothing* to you. You are half deity, after all. Can you truly say that you are no different than any other mortal?~
@64   = ~No, but I certainly wish it were so. If I had been born of a mortal man, perhaps I would not have had to see my life torn away, my companions tortured and murdered...~
@65   = ~Yes! I am the same as anyone else, and I don't care what anyone says to the contrary!~
@66   = ~No. I am stronger, faster, smarter and more powerful than these weaklings surrounding me.~
@67   = ~Haer'Dalis, would you please just get to the point?~
@68   = ~It was not this sparrow's desire to bring you sadness. Allow me to artfully turn the subject away from such thoughts.~
@69   = ~Perhaps if you say it often enough and loud enough it will become truth, dear raven. You would not be the first, nor the last I daresay, to attempt such a thing.~
@70   = ~Ah, traits inherited from your father, no doubt. Along with many others.~
@71   = ~Give this sparrow just another moment of your time, I beg you.~
@72   = ~Forgive me if my inquiries seem abrupt, but I admit that I have gone to some lengths to seek information about you. I would be a fool to know nothing of those I travel with, even if my benefactor has delivered me from an unpleasant fate once or twice.~
@73   = ~Sadly, for all I have learned, I still feel as though I know very little of you. The real <CHARNAME> is a mystery, an alluring enigma.~
@74   = ~What would you like to know? I'm an open book, as they say.~
@75   = ~I think I prefer it that way, Haer'Dalis.~
@76   = ~This is a line, isn't it? I've known enough smooth-tongued bards in my life to see you coming a mile away.~
@77   = ~I'll wager this 'real me' you seek is warm, willing and sans clothing. Am I right?~
@78   = ~I'm not the type to just go blabbing my life to a virtual stranger.~
@79   = ~It's none of your business, bard.~
@80   = ~Truly? I admit I am surprised, and pleasantly so! Perhaps we should return to your tasks for now, but it will undoubtedly be a pleasure getting to know you.~
@81   = ~I understand your hesitation. In your shoes, I would likely feel much the same if pressed. But, come! There will likely be time to explore my wandering curiosity another day.~
@82   = ~My word, but you are a suspicious one! I wish I could say I did not find that so intriguing.~
@83   = ~Very well, I shall curb my wagging tongue. For now.~
@84   = ~Isn't it? I am in your company now, part of your journey, fighting your battles at your side. Is it so much to ask to know something of you?~
@85   = ~I suppose not.~
@86   = ~I think I prefer to keep things professional between us, Haer'Dalis.~
@87   = ~Yes, it is. So leave me alone. Got it?~
@88   = ~This life of adventure you lead is full of excitement and noise and constant moving, my raven, yet you seem well enough adjusted to it.~
@89   = ~As do you.~
@90   = ~I suppose I am, though this life was hardly my choice.~
@91   = ~I'm comfortable in any setting. It's in my nature to adapt.~
@92   = ~Adjusted? I detest this life and wish for nothing more than to lead a normal existence! But the choice was never offered to me.~
@93   = ~What are you getting at?~
@94   = ~Aye, that rings true. Few persons of sound mind would purposely choose a life of blood and violence, and those who do rarely survive long enough for bards to remember their names.~
@95   = ~Tell me truly, are you always this guarded when you converse with your companions?~
@96   = ~I'm not trying to be guarded. I'm just not used to someone making idle conversation like this.~
@97   = ~I don't really know you very well. You can't expect me to just trust you unreservedly, can you?~
@98   = ~No, but your motivations worry me. Why are you being so friendly?~
@99   = ~Yes, actually. Betrayal is only one misplaced trust away at any given moment.~
@100  = ~Maybe I'm just not interested in talking with you.~
@101  = ~It is understandable that you feel thus, but unfortunate that one so young must feel so jaded while life is yet fresh and new. Perhaps you are not as accustomed to this life as I'd assumed.~
@102  = ~What makes you presume friendship is my goal? Perhaps I am merely curious, or perhaps I'm unnaturally nosy toward all I meet in my travels. Or mayhap this clever sparrow seeks to root out your dirty little secrets, as they say, and save them for a special occasion.~
@103  = ~Do your worst, bard. I am no stranger to mind games.~
@104  = ~Jest all you like, but my concerns are valid. I hardly know you, and I don't trust strangers.~
@105  = ~Hah, I have no secrets. My whole life's story seems spread about for any random soul to pick apart at will! I bet even the beggars could give you answers nearly as accurate as my own.~
@106  = ~You won't be such a clever sparrow when you're plucked, stuffed and roasted, now will you? For the last time, mind your own business.~
@107  = ~How dare you! Who do you think you are, to say such things to me?~
@108  = ~Oh-ho, but I do love a challenge! Truly, you do intrigue me, my beguiling raven.~
@109  = ~In this I must disagree most vehemently. Your story has indeed been oft told by many people, but 'tis decidedly untrue to say that any other person could give me as complete a recitation as you yourself are capable of providing. A direct source is always preferable to secondary hearsay. That is why I seek your thoughts, and not those of another.~
@110  = ~But you *are* my business, raven, and have been since you saved this frail sparrow from imprisonment not once, but twice!~
@111  = ~And if, for whatever reason, you believe threats will deflect my interest, then you are most certainly mistaken. The effect is quite the opposite, in fact.~
@112  = ~I think I am Haer'Dalis, your humble sparrow, of course! And you, my dear Daughter of Bhaal, have a temper to rival a balor, it seems.~
@113  = ~'Twould be wise for me to bow and leave you to seethe in peace, lest your head explode... or mine.~
@114  = ~This sparrow cannot imagine living a stationary life, locked in place, secreted away from the danger and excitement of the world. 'Tis a good thing I find myself in the company of one who never lacks for either.~
@115  = ~I'm glad you're happy here.~
@116  = ~I'm glad for your company as well.~
@117  = ~I will admit, another sort of life seems dull in comparison.~
@118  = ~I enjoy the danger and excitement, too. And the killing. And the bloodshed. Why are we just standing here where there are things to be destroyed?~
@119  = ~Honestly, some stability would do me wonders. All this traveling, fighting, struggling... It becomes wearisome after a while.~
@120  = ~I hate this life and would be glad to be rid of it!~
@121  = ~Wasn't your time with Raelis filled with danger and excitement as well?~
@122  = ~'Tis a pleasure to follow where you lead, my raven. Never doubt this.~
@123  = ~'Tis truth you've spoken, my friend. Even if we could be anything other than what we are now, would we truly wish for the change? Such dreams are folly, and often lead to despair.~
@124  = ~Hah, but how your eyes shine when you speak of such things! Let not this frail sparrow stand in your way, my fierce hound!~
@125  = ~Wearisome, yes, but far better than growing complacent with the mundane, would you not agree? Besides, stolen moments of calm are not impossible to find, if a person truly wishes to find them.~
@126  = ~If that is so, why do you struggle onward? Should you not simply stop and let the world swallow you whole? From what I've seen, there are more than enough enemies seeking your blood to do the job adequately.~
@127  = ~What? No! Just because I hate my life doesn't mean I seek death!~
@128  = ~I honestly don't know sometimes. Maybe I should give up. Maybe I'm afraid of what will happen if I do.~
@129  = ~I've tried to give up, Haer'Dalis. I've tried to die, but I always survive. Why?~
@130  = ~And let them *win*? To all the hells with that idea!~
@131  = ~Fine, maybe things aren't as bad as I make them out to be, but sometimes life can be so wearisome. It can be hard to carry onward.~
@132  = ~You're terrible at inspirational speeches, you know that?~
@133  = ~Seek it or not, death will eventually catch you up, as it must all of us, but that is not my point at this juncture. Perhaps I simply do not see the purpose of your life, if not to live it, and how can you truly live if you hate the life you have?~
@134  = ~'Twas not my intention to rouse your wrath, my raven. At least, not today. I shall bow and make my exit before this sparrow digs himself a deeper hole, as you Primes like to say.~
@135  = ~Ah, I can hear the bittersweet song of entropy in your words.~
@136  = ~'Tis the way of all things to decay and die, to fade and be forgotten, but this sparrow is curious to see how long you will fight before you too are drawn to your end.~
@137  = ~But that end will not come today, I think. Let us be off and discover if I am right, shall we?~
@138  = ~Hah! A fire rages within your soul, my raven. 'Tis truly a sight to behold, while it lasts.~
@139  = ~This sparrow has had similar sentiments directed at him in the past. Very well. I shall keep my song to myself.~
@140  = ~Ah, Miss Raelis. I suppose it is accurate to say that she carried about with her a level of danger and excitement, yes, but it was of a different sort. 'Twas all intrigue and manipulation and machinations, and far less violence and blood and glorious battle. Traveling with you is but the opposite - a veritable flood of the latter, with just the proper splash of the former to keep this sparrow riveted.~
@141  = ~My raven, my Child of Bhaal, this sparrow has been deep in thought since last we spoke and I have a proposal for you, one which you are sure to find irresistible.~
@142  = ~I'm still trying to figure out how exactly I became *your* raven.~
@143  = ~Then by all means, my dear sparrow, say on!~
@144  = ~'Irresistible,' huh? Continue.~
@145  = ~Do I have time for this? No, I don't think I do.~
@146  = ~Whatever it is, the answer is no.~
@147  = ~Why do I have a feeling I'm not going to like the next words out of your mouth?~
@148  = ~What is this? I never told you I was a Child of Bhaal!~
@149  = ~Ah... you didn't? But I could have sworn you did. Perhaps you took a blow to the head that has damaged your memory.~
@150  = ~Don't treat me like a fool! You and I know damned well I told you to mind your own business, and here you are, flouting your stolen information!~
@151  = ~One of these days, bard, that tongue of yours is going to get you killed.~
@152  = ~Right. Head trauma. That *must* be it.~
@153  = ~I did take a vicious thwack on my forehead not long ago...~
@154  = ~I suppose it doesn't really matter. You were bound to discover the truth eventually.~
@155  = ~Perhaps you're right. I can't recall if I told you or not.~
@156  = ~I would hardly call it flouting, and 'tis far from stolen! Your name is on the loose lips of any number of Primes. 'Twas no work at all to learn of your parentage. One merely has to listen to hear your song.~
@157  = ~Oh, but I could not agree more, and you are not the first to make such a prophecy, I can assure you.~
@158  = ~It's a relief that you've chosen to be reasonable, as it will surely make my proposal more alluring.~
@159  = ~Er... yes, exactly. You really should be more careful, my dear raven. Now let's get back to discussing my proposal!~
@160  = ~If you wish to be angry with this sparrow, be angry after I've made my request.~
@161  = ~'Tis a fair trade. After all, I am *your* sparrow, and at your command.~
@162  = ~Pfft, that's hardly a fair trade.~
@163  = ~Must you be so insufferably charming?~
@164  = ~Heh... okay, that's a little bit cute.~
@165  = ~Yeah, whatever you say.~
@166  = ~I don't like it, so knock it off already.~
@167  = ~Ah, you flatter me, but you should not devalue yourself so.~
@168  = ~'Tis in this sparrow's nature to be so.~
@169  = ~But, come! 'Tis unfair how you manage to steer the topic away from this most meaningful of questions. Shall I say on?~
@170  = ~Of course, my dear sparrow! Say on!~
@171  = ~I suppose.~
@172  = ~If you must.~
@173  = ~No.~
@174  = ~Oh, do not look so put out, my raven. I exist only to make your life more interesting, and it pleases me that the reverse is true as well.~
@175  = ~Hmm... well, then I shall simply speak, and you can choose whether or not you wish to listen.~
@176  = ~You possess a rare and beautiful spirit that outshines even the brightest star.~
@177  = ~See? Your keen perceptions are not always correct. But you shall not distract me from my purpose!~
@178  = ~You, my dear raven, lead a life of mystery, intrigue and violence. Whether you will it or not, chaos follows you, and I find it most pleasing to stand witness to such unreserved destruction.~
@179  = ~And that is why I simply must put quill to parchment and write your story, from start to finish! It would be most unfair of me to keep the priceless jewel that is your life hidden from the world. I must know all there is to know of you! Every morsel, every scrap, every tawdry detail! Will you give me leave to do this?~
@180  = ~That does sound interesting. What if we wrote it together, though?~
@181  = ~If it means that much to you, I see no harm in it.~
@182  = ~Well... okay. And hells, maybe it'll even put some of these rumors about me to rest.~
@183  = ~I'm not so sure about this, Haer'Dalis.~
@184  = ~No. Just, no.~
@185  = ~What?! Never!~
@186  = ~Hah, I expected you might say as much! Splendid!~
@187  = ~You are neither minstrel nor actress nor writer and, beg this sparrow's pardon, but I do not see why you would wish to attempt to become such now.~
@188  = ~Be that as it may, I still want to be part of the process. It is *my* life after all.~
@189  = ~Good point. Very well, if it means that much to you, you may write my story, Haer'Dalis.~
@190  = ~Oh, fine, fine. And hells, maybe it'll even put some of these rumors about me to rest.~
@191  = ~If I don't agree, you're just going to do it anyway, aren't you?~
@192  = ~Then forget it.~
@193  = ~No, this is a bad idea.~
@194  = ~Oh, very well. How can I deny such a persuasive woman?~
@195  = ~Very well. I... well, I shall do everything in my power to include your feedback in this most grand of adventures.~
@196  = ~Excellent! You shall not regret this, my raven, I assure you.~
@197  = ~Or create more perhaps? Either way, 'tis a grand undertaking!~
@198  = ~Ah, my gentle raven! Do you not see the value of sharing your experiences with the world? Tell me what I must do to persuade you!~
@199  = ~Well... if it means that much to you, I see no harm in it.~
@200  = ~Fine. Maybe it'll even put some of these rumors about me to rest.~
@201  = ~You'll do *anything*?~
@202  = ~There is nothing you can say or do, so let it go!~
@203  = ~I was certain your passion to further the Art would urge you to say otherwise. Is there no way I can persuade you to change your mind?~
@204  = ~Oh, very well, I suppose it does sound interesting. But I want to write it together.~
@205  = ~I said no!~
@206  = ~Ah, my dear raven, must you be so difficult? This is an opportunity we cannot allow to pass by! Come, what must be done to persuade you otherwise, hmm?~
@207  = ~My word, I do not know if I like that gleam in your eye. Whatever did you have in mind, my bold raven?~
@208  = ~A kiss would do, I think.~
@209  = ~Stand on your head and sing a bawdy drinking song.~
@210  = ~Ah, never mind. If it means so much to you, you can write my story I suppose.~
@211  = ~Ugh, forget it. I have no interest in telling you anything!~
@212  = ~My gear, weapons and armor make such a request rather difficult. Perhaps something else?~
@213  = ~Fine. How about a kiss instead?~
@214  = ~Forget it. I have no interest in telling you anything!~
@215  = ~Hah! You *are* a bold one, aren't you? I wonder if all women of the Prime are this brazen, or if it is specific only to you. But if it shall change your mind, who am I to deny you?~
@216  = ~(Grin and wait.)~
@217  = ~(Hold your breath and wait anxiously.)~
@218  = ~Well? Get on with it then.~
@219  = ~(With a sly gleam in his dark eyes, Haer'Dalis steps close, his face hovering near enough for you to feel the heat of his skin on yours. The tiefling smells of leather and dust and an almost imperceptible hint of brimstone. His fingertips tease along your jaw, tilting your chin up just before his warm lips brush yours in a light, sweet kiss that lingers for a few, brief heartbeats before he steps away.)~
@220  = ~'Tis a deal, then, bound and sealed, and one I shall hold you to, my raven.~
@221  = ~(With a sly gleam in his dark eyes, Haer'Dalis kneels down, his face hovering near enough for you to feel the heat of his skin on yours. The tiefling smells of leather and dust and an almost imperceptible hint of brimstone. His fingertips tease along your jaw, tilting your chin up just before his warm lips brush yours in a light, sweet kiss that lingers for a few, brief heartbeats before he leans back.)~
@222  = ~My stubborn raven, might I inquire why you are so set against my proposal?~
@223  = ~Fine, you can write my story.~
@224  = ~It's a matter of trust, Haer'Dalis. I still hardly know you.~
@225  = ~Oh, I don't know... maybe you should try harder to persuade me, hmm?~
@226  = ~I don't need a reason, and my answer will always be no.~
@227  = ~Because I've heard your talentless drivel, bard, and I have no desire to see my life thus butchered.~
@228  = ~I see. I suppose I cannot fault you for that, though it saddens this sparrow.~
@229  = ~I have your answer, then. If you will excuse me, my raven.~
@230  = ~Such harsh words, my hound. Very well. This sparrow retreats.~
@231  = ~Allow me time to organize my thoughts, if that is even possible, but we shall speak again soon, fair <CHARNAME>.~
@232  = ~Now, wait just a moment. If you're going to start asking me probing personal questions, I might start asking some in return as well.~
@233  = ~Of course. Just let me know when you're ready, my sparrow.~
@234  = ~Tsk, tsk, how unprofessional.~
@235  = ~I'm having second thoughts about this already...~
@236  = ~I suppose I would not be completely against such an exchange.~
@237  = ~You deserve an artist at his best, not some half-thought out babbling! Surely you understand.~
@238  = ~I understand that you're a hapless flatterer. How much did you pay for that gilded tongue, hmm?~
@239  = ~Ah, you wound me so! I speak nothing but the truth, my raven... and let us simply say 'twas not a meager price. But worth the cost, wouldn't you agree?~
@240  = ~Then I recommend you stop thinking immediately.~
@241  = ~Until next we speak, my raven.~
@242  = ~I know of your father, dear raven, but what of your mother? Are you the mirror's likeness of the fair woman? Where were you born?~
@243  = ~Wow, so many questions at once.~
@244  = ~I didn't realize you were going to ask me things like this.~
@245  = ~The answer to all of that is, 'I don't know.'~
@246  = ~Okay, perhaps I didn't make myself clear. I'm *not* going to talk about my life with you!~
@247  = ~(sigh) You haven't given up.~
@248  = ~All tales must have a beginning, and would you not agree that your purest beginning was your birth?~
@249  = ~If I tell you about myself, I want you to answer some of my questions, too.~
@250  = ~Tell me about yourself first. You're such a mystery to me.~
@251  = ~Very well. Where to start...?~
@252  = ~But why? Why are you so interested in me?~
@253  = ~I don't think I'm comfortable with this.~
@254  = ~No. I don't want to talk about myself with you.~
@255  = ~Is the answer not obvious enough? As a planewalker, I am enamored of that which I have not experienced, and as a Doomguard, I am drawn to the inevitability of death and decay, two things which follow you eagerly. And of course, as a bard, I cannot help but desire knowledge of unusual and interesting tales.~
@256  = ~You see? You have piqued my interest on all fronts. A rare occurrence indeed.~
@257  = ~So, it's only my experiences you're after? I thought you were interested in *me*.~
@258  = ~You make me sound like some strange creature you want to study.~
@259  = ~Very well then, but the answer to almost every question about my early life is, 'I don't know.'~
@260  = ~No, I don't want to talk about myself with you.~
@261  = ~I assure you most heartily, I am.~
@262  = ~I offer an exchange, then. A question for a question, an answer for an answer. Anything I ask of you, you may ask of me. Will that satisfy you?~
@263  = ~Perhaps. But I warn you, I'm not easily satisfied.~
@264  = ~And you'll actually give me a straight answer?~
@265  = ~My, aren't you a sharp one? I shall endeavor to provide answers which fully satisfy your curiosity, my suspicious raven.~
@266  = ~Okay, but I warn you, I'm not easily satisfied.~
@267  = ~We shall see about that, hmm? I have been complimented on my talent for satisfaction.~
@268  = ~I have heard it said that many women of the Prime say 'no' when they really mean 'yes.' Is there no truth to this proverb?~
@269  = ~Hah! Actually there is. Okay, have it your way, but I'm afraid you'll be disappointed by my answer. I don't know much of anything about my mother or where I was born.~
@270  = ~No, there isn't, but if it will get you to stop asking, I will tell you what I know: nothing. I know nothing about my mother or where I was born.~
@271  = ~Well, maybe. But I still don't want to talk about it, Haer'Dalis.~
@272  = ~No, there isn't, and it's offensive for you to suggest such a thing.~
@273  = ~Absolutely not, now leave me be!~
@274  = ~(sigh) I could hardly bear to live with myself if you forced me to seek out other sources of information to learn what I need to know about you, my raven.~
@275  = ~Oh, fine. What do you want to know?~
@276  = ~You wouldn't... would you?~
@277  = ~Don't you dare! My life is mine alone, not something for you to pick apart and sell to the world!~
@278  = ~Good luck with that, bard. Now leave me be.~
@279  = ~If you even attempt such a foolish thing, I will gut you myself.~
@280  = ~Haer'Dalis, you are a tactless, talentless fraud, and I swear I will never tell you anything of me!~
@281  = ~I will do what I must, of course.~
@282  = ~If that is your wish.~
@283  = ~This threat is not a deterrent for one such as myself. 'Tis all the more reason to dig deeper into that which you guard so valiantly. But for now this sparrow retreats, lest you claw out my eyes in your fury.~
@284  = ~I see. Then this sparrow retreats, my hound.~
@285  = ~That would go against my very nature, my dear raven. All life is born to decay and die. Is that not all the more reason to take as much from life as possible? To taste, to touch, to breathe in every experience until this sparrow is full to bursting?~
@286  = ~Tell me of the fair woman who brought you into this world, my raven.~
@287  = ~I don't know anything about my mother, unfortunately.~
@288  = ~There's nothing to tell since I don't remember her.~
@289  = ~Um, she gave birth to me. That's about all I know.~
@290  = ~You never met your mother?~
@291  = ~No. All I really know is that she and Gorion were once lovers, and that he took me in when I was just a baby.~
@292  = ~She's dead. Gorion never took the time to tell me anything about her, really.~
@293  = ~Sometimes I think I have these... fragments of memories about her. But that's probably just wishful thinking.~
@294  = ~It doesn't matter. I can't miss what I never had.~
@295  = ~See? Not that interesting after all, eh?~
@296  = ~Ah, Gorion was your foster father, yes? I have heard scraps of information about him as well.~
@297  = ~Such as?~
@298  = ~I... it's hard to talk about him...~
@299  = ~He was the only father I ever knew. He only wanted the best for me, even knowing the darkness inside of me.~
@300  = ~Gorion was a decent man, if a bit misguided. Some of the things he did will never make sense to me.~
@301  = ~He kept me prisoner, locked away from the world and denied the truth of who and what I am.~
@302  = ~The old fool feared my true potential and did everything in his power to hold me back from my destiny. I'm glad to be rid of him.~
@303  = ~Be content with your scraps. I have nothing to say of him.~
@304  = ~Aye, the decay of the mind and its memories can bring a bittersweet pain.~
@305  = ~I often wonder on the truth of that claim. And the sincerity of the one delivering it.~
@306  = ~On the contrary, I find you all the more intriguing for it.~
@307  = ~You were raised by a man named Gorion, were you not? I have heard scraps of information about him as well.~
@308  = ~That he was a mage and Harper both, and that he was killed not long ago, but little more than this is known to me. Will you enlighten this poor sparrow?~
@309  = ~Surely Primes have heard that the hardest things to do are the most worthwhile.~
@310  = ~The old fool kept me from my true potential and did everything in his power to hold me back from my destiny. I'm glad to be rid of him.~
@311  = ~You mourn his passing even still? 'Tis a destiny none of us can escape, but you are no Doomguard, and it seems you loved him well. Thus I cannot fault your sorrow.~
@312  = ~Aye, this seems a common enough theme between parent and child, but perhaps the natural rift was widened by his knowledge of your sire.~
@313  = ~Ah, a caged raven, were you? That is not a life I would wish upon anyone, but I celebrate that you've found your freedom.~
@314  = ~A rather mercenary view to be sure, but not surprising considering your sire and your struggles thus far.~
@315  = ~Tell me, how did the dear man broach the subject of your divine conception? 'Twould likely be a scene worthy of note in the play that is your life. Were there tears? Anger? Callous sentiment, either genuine or otherwise, flung in distraught disbelief?~
@316  = ~He was murdered before he could tell me the truth. I grew up believing I was normal.~
@317  = ~He didn't tell me. I found a letter after he died that explained the truth.~
@318  = ~The coward never told me anything. Lied to, my whole life! I had to find out from a damned letter *after* he died!~
@319  = ~Nothing like that. One of Sarevok's followers told me, long after Gorion was killed.~
@320  = ~In some ways I feel like I always knew. People treated me strangely, and I always felt... different. I only found out the truth for certain after Gorion died.~
@321  = ~To be honest, I can't remember how exactly I learned the truth, but it wasn't from Gorion. He died before he could tell me.~
@322  = ~I'm done discussing this. We need to get moving.~
@323  = ~Can this be true? I...  Forgive me, <CHARNAME>, but truly I am baffled!~
@324  = ~The progeny of a dead god as his ward, your young mind so easily bent and shaped by the slightest breeze, yet this Gorion keeps the truth from you? Astounding! What purpose could such deceit serve? This sparrow is often perplexed by the decisions of Primes, but this particular choice seems to outmeasure even the most foolish of common folly.~
@325  = ~What are you saying? That he should have used me? That it would have been wiser for him to take advantage of my blood?~
@326  = ~He wanted to protect me. By letting me grow up as a normal girl, I think he believed Bhaal would have less hold over me when I did discover the truth.~
@327  = ~To be fair, it's hardly the kind of thing that would be easy to tell someone. 'How was your day? Oh, by the way, your father was an evil, murdering god. Make sure you eat all your peas, dear.'~
@328  = ~You and me both, my sparrow. I bear him no grudge, but I cannot say I would have done the same in his shoes.~
@329  = ~I can never forgive him for the lies he spun. How could he live with himself, knowing he was deceiving a *child*?~
@330  = ~As I've said since the day Sarevok struck him down, good riddance to him.~
@331  = ~You are completely missing the point! Many choices lay before your grave mage, each with its own path and destination. The one he walked, my dear raven, served to aid none but those who might mean you harm. Instead of arming you with truth and knowledge, preparing you for an uncertain but surely violent future, he donned the false face of 'Father' and left his young raven weak and vulnerable to any who might wish you ill!~
@332  = ~Do not mistake me. 'Tis not a judgment of the man that I offer, merely awe at the choice that was made.~
@333  = ~'Tis a strange sort of protection, if you ask this sparrow. Do you think he succeeded? In lessening Bhaal's grip on your tender soul, that is.~
@334  = ~Yes, I think he did. Perhaps growing up 'normal' made it possible for me to distance myself from the taint because I feel very little influence from my father's darker urges.~
@335  = ~Considering the personality of my deceased 'brother,' I'd have to say Gorion had some success, yes.~
@336  = ~Maybe. I still struggle. I suppose it could be worse, but I'd rather not think about such things.~
@337  = ~Not really, no. Bhaal is always there, in the back of mind. It's not something I can just ignore, no matter how protected my upbringing was.~
@338  = ~I don't know what it feels like to be raised any other way, to live any other life, to have any other sire, so how can I reasonably answer such a question?~
@339  = ~Perhaps. Or perhaps clinging to the belief that his protection served a purpose lessens the guilt of his death for my young raven, hmm?~
@340  = ~Aye, thinking is a double-edge sword, is it not? Hah! We could both benefit from doing it more often, I daresay. Or perhaps less often.~
@341  = ~There's no use hiding from a piece of yourself, is there? One would think your lost Gorion would have been wise enough to see the truth of that.~
@342  = ~Ah, my clever raven! You speak wisdom beyond your years, 'tis certain! A pity we will never know what you would have become had you but walked a darker path in your youth. What a fascinating reflection that would be to witness.~
@343  = ~True enough, but such excuses could stretch a lifetime, my raven. Would you rather wander blind and blissful all your years, or walk 'neath the heavy burden of truth?~
@344  = ~Blind and blissful has a certain appeal, Haer'Dalis.~
@345  = ~The truth, always. No matter how painful, it's always better to have everything out in the open.~
@346  = ~A nice mix of both suits me just fine.~
@347  = ~It's always worked best for me to carry the truth, but smile and feign ignorance for the world to see.~
@348  = ~I usually stumble around without a clue, hoping most people will assume I know what I'm doing and not call my bluff.~
@349  = ~Many a berk has said the very same of a lovely succubus. This does not make walking willingly into her arms a wise decision.~
@350  = ~Always, you say? Then I suppose this sparrow should have told you that your hair was a dreadful fright yesterday, and judging by the smell, I am fairly certain you stepped in horse droppings not long ago.~
@351  = ~A compromise that most adopt readily, though the balance shifts and sways between sagacity and buffoonery with dizzying speed.~
@352  = ~Ah, my delightful raven, in this we are birds of a feather. 'Tis always easier when people assume you cannot know what you already know.~
@353  = ~Clueless you may feel, but if you are, either fate or some god or another is most certainly watching your progress with great interest for you to have survived thus far. This is no easy path you travel, my raven. Perhaps you do not give yourself due credit.~
@354  = ~Aye, I cannot begrudge you such bitterness, not when I myself feel a dark anger stir within me each time I imagine a free creature such as yourself locked away behind bars of iron and lies.~
@355  = ~If I may ask, what would you have done, were you in his place with a god-sired child in your care?~
@356  = ~I honestly don't know.~
@357  = ~I would have told the truth from the start. I would never have let a child grow up believing a lie.~
@358  = ~The child would have grown up with full knowledge of his or her destiny, that's for sure.~
@359  = ~I would have waited until the child was old enough to think reasonably, then told him or her the truth.~
@360  = ~Maybe I would have done the same thing Gorion did. I don't like it, but I just can't imagine explaining all of that to a child, and in a way they would understand.~
@361  = ~That would depend on what I stood to gain from the child. If explaining the truth would ultimately benefit me more than a lie, then I would tell the truth, and vice versa.~
@362  = ~A truthful, if unimaginative reply. Though, if this sparrow must be perfectly honest, I cannot say what I would have done either.~
@363  = ~Aye? No lies at all? No ghost stories or fairytales or imaginary friends? These are merely lies if different sorts, you know, so one would think that pure truth bears very little resemblance to childhood.~
@364  = ~I wonder if Gorion knew anything of your 'destiny,' as you say, or if he was as clueless as you are in that regard.~
@365  = ~'Tis likely this was Gorion's reasoning as well. Caution has a way of growing out of control, and hesitation leads to dire consequences just as often as rash actions.~
@366  = ~Ah, methinks you are coming to realize that you are more like your foster father than you once thought.~
@367  = ~My ruthless raven, you would fit in quite well in Sigil.~
@368  = ~Ah, but here we are, babbling away whilst there is adventure and action awaiting us around the next bend! Come, my raven. You've given me much to think on.~
@369  = ~My radiant half-goddess, tell me of this tainted blood that flows through your veins. How does it feel? What bits and pieces of Bhaal live on in you?~
@370  = ~Radiant half-goddess?~
@371  = ~None. I am nothing like Bhaal, and any taint in my blood has no affect upon my choices.~
@372  = ~I have developed a few minor powers, presumably 'gifts' from my sire. Other than that, he is of little consequence to me.~
@373  = ~I suppose I don't really know how deep his influence runs.~
@374  = ~He is as much part of me as my hands or my liver. I can no more ignore Bhaal than ignore my lungs.~
@375  = ~Bhaal may have given me an edge over the mortal simpletons who spawn all around me, but I grow stronger with each battle. Someday my power will be greater than any trace castoff of a dead god that might linger in me.~
@376  = ~Gods above, Haer'Dalis, I don't want to talk about these things with you!~
@377  = ~Still haven't given up I see.~
@378  = ~'Tis only the truth I sing! Surely such faint praise does not offend you, my raven.~
@379  = ~None at all? Are you living this life of adventure, violence and bloodshed of your own free will then?~
@380  = ~More than a little, if your chosen lifestyle is any indication, aye?~
@381  = ~Aye, an honest enough answer. I wonder, will you ever know the answer? *Can* you ever know the answer?~
@382  = ~You speak wisdom, my friend. Were you not Bhaal's progeny, I cannot imagine you would be standing here with this sparrow right now.~
@383  = ~Is that your intent then, my raven? To reach for godhood or something very like it? 'Tis an ambitious goal, and one many have tried to attain before you.~
@384  = ~But *I* want to talk about them! Have you not a care for my needs, my sweet raven? But of course you do!~
@385  = ~Some part of you enjoys my attention, raven, else I think you'd have long since silenced my tongue.~
@386  = ~But this does not tell me what I most long to know! Come, my dark raven, does Bhaal speak to you from beyond the grave? Does the taint call to you in whispered urges of things you'd not otherwise desire?~
@387  = ~Haer'Dalis, I am as normal as any other person. Stop trying to make me out to be some kind of monster!~
@388  = ~Honestly, the taint is little more than a vague annoyance. My sleep is disturbed by strange dreams at times, but I feel very little connection to any sort of dark urges or anything of the sort.~
@389  = ~It's not so dramatic as all that. I have had dreams, and sometimes it's hard for me to calm myself after a battle, but these things are subtle and I manage them well enough.~
@390  = ~Would you think me mad if I said I hear Bhaal's voice in my mind? That he stalks my dreams and all but begs me to murder every person I see? If I let myself run on instinct alone, Haer'Dalis, there would be far fewer people alive in this world.~
@391  = ~The taint is a dangerous beast, barely caged within me. Bhaal whispers and screams in turns, hounding my dreams, always urging me toward blood, murder and destruction. It's a constant struggle between me, <CHARNAME>, and the monster inside.~
@392  = ~It's kind of amusing, to be honest. Here I am, leaving a sea of bodies in my wake, killing every person who even seems to be standing in my way, and still my sire sends me dreams, urging me to murder *more*. It's an insatiable hunger, let me assure you.~
@393  = ~I don't wish to speak of these things with you. Let's get moving.~
@394  = ~Listen, fool, I've had all I can take of your probing and prodding! Now be silent, before I take your tactless ramblings and shove them down your talentless throat!~
@395  = ~Alas, if that is your desire, your poor wounded sparrow shall obey. Allow me a moment of mourning, if you will.~
@396  = ~I see. This sparrow retreats, as directed.~
@397  = ~You may not wish to hear it, my raven, but you are wrong on both counts. You have little to nothing in common with a person of mortal parentage, as is proven by both your lifestyle and by your enemies. The average Prime is not hunted by powerful foes the likes of which stalk your every move, and is even less likely to flourish upon this life of violence as you so clearly do.~
@398  = ~And to your second accusation, I assure you it simply is not so. You are fascinating, beautiful, powerful, dangerous - yes, all these things. But this sparrow gives you his word that he will never believe you a monster, no matter your choices or what may befall you. You are something infinitely greater, and cannot be made less.~
@399  = ~My only wish is to better know you. Now tell me, will you answer my questions?~
@400  = ~The taint is little more than an vague annoyance. My sleep is disturbed by strange dreams at times, but I feel very little connection to any sort of dark urges or anything of the sort.~
@401  = ~If you insist, but really it's not so dramatic as all that. I have had dreams, and sometimes it's hard for me to calm myself after a battle, but these things are subtle and I manage them well enough.~
@402  = ~But I do feel like a monster sometimes. The taint is a dangerous beast, barely caged within me. Bhaal whispers and screams in turns, hounding my dreams, always urging me toward blood and murder and destruction. It's a constant struggle between me, <CHARNAME>, and the monster inside.~
@403  = ~It's kind of amusing, to be honest. Here I am, leaving a sea of bodies in my wake, killing every person who even seems to be standing in my way, and still my sire sends me dreams, urging me to murder *more.* It's an insatiable hunger, let me assure you.~
@404  = ~No, I won't. Let's get moving.~
@405  = ~Truly? You are a strong woman, so it comes as little surprise to this sparrow that you have your internal turmoil under your command, but I had wondered if your control was an act you put on for the benefit of the watching world.~
@406  = ~Ah, madness - beautiful and terrible, wise and reckless. We are all of us mad in our own ways, my hound, have no doubt of that.~
@407  = ~You speak as though you fear yourself or what you might become. I do not envy you, but you have more strength than you believe to have survived thus far. Do not doubt that.~
@408  = ~One wonders how much carnage it would take to sate such desires. What would your hunger do once the world was emptied of lives to take?~
@409  = ~Tell me of these dreams. What are they like?~
@410  = ~I never really remember much, actually. I know that they're not like other dreams, but I don't really know how or why or what happened after I wake.~
@411  = ~They're very vague. Lots of whispering and mist, almost like someone or something is speaking to some hidden part of my mind.~
@412  = ~Violent. Death everywhere, blood, screaming, bodies. My dreams are saturated in murder.~
@413  = ~Let's just say Bhaal really likes the sound - and volume - of his own voice. Subtle he is not, but his bellowing sure gets his point across.~
@414  = ~Terribly dull compared to the dreams I've had of you, my sparrow.~
@415  = ~That's enough of this. Let's get moving.~
@416  = ~You hear an actual voice? Words? Fascinating! I had presumed feelings or intuitions or some such, but never actual words in your mind!~
@417  = ~What do these dreams make you feel?~
@418  = ~Not much. I don't enjoy having my sleep interrupted, but I don't wake up in a cold sweat or anything dramatic like that.~
@419  = ~Fury, barely contained and desperate for an outlet. Like I could tear the head off the first person I see.~
@420  = ~Angry, but the anger is not mine. It's almost like I can stand to one side and look objectively at this murderous *thing* inside me, but the dreams seem to call to it and strengthen it. It's hard to explain.~
@421  = ~I fear what I see, Haer'Dalis. I don't want to become what I see in my dreams. Sometimes I wish I could just run and hide from who I am.~
@422  = ~Powerful, of course. I gladly embrace any advantage I can find, and if these dreams can lead me to even greater power, I will heed them.~
@423  = ~More confused than anything else. I often feel like I'm two people in one body, each trying to go its own direction. These dreams seem to drive a deeper divide between the two pieces of me.~
@424  = ~Nothing compared to the feelings I get when I dream of you, my sparrow.~
@425  = ~Surely you'll forgive this sparrow if he feels it necessary to embellish certain details of your life, aye? A Bhaalspawn's dreams should be filled with anger and blood and murder! Or that is what your audience will expect, of course.~
@426  = ~You're going to exaggerate my life because it's too *boring*? You must be joking!~
@427  = ~No, absolutely no exaggerations! If you're telling my story, it has to be *my* story, not some fabrication!~
@428  = ~Feel free. While you're at it, throw in a dash of 'heaving bosom' and 'flowing hair' and 'enchanting beauty,' eh?~
@429  = ~There are more direct ways for you to add some spice to my life, my sparrow.~
@430  = ~Let's just get moving.~
@431  = ~Only these very few parts in desperate need of excitement, my raven, I assure you!~
@432  = ~Truly? I did not think you one to appreciate such drivel, but perhaps I can... hmm... Yes, I can see how that might work...~
@433  = ~Fascinating, and not entirely unexpected. Still, I shall make certain I am never the one to wake you in the morning from this moment forward, my raven.~
@434  = ~That's a good idea.~
@435  = ~It's not all that bad.~
@436  = ~Depends on how you wake me up, my sparrow.~
@437  = ~Strange, but intriguing. It sounds as though you are merely a vessel for Bhaal's taint, and perhaps the taint is not so much a part of you as it is... inside of you?~
@438  = ~That is exactly what I feel like - a vessel.~
@439  = ~Close enough, I suppose.~
@440  = ~Not really, no, but as I said, it's hard to explain.~
@441  = ~Sparrow, that sounded rather like a decidedly lewd innuendo.~
@442  = ~Know that this sparrow looks upon you and sees much more than that.~
@443  = ~Perhaps another time you will tell me more of this, aye? 'Twould please me to understand you as best I am able.~
@444  = ~Ah, but to run and hide would do you no good. Surely you know this. And just think how painfully dull your life would be without all this adventure and mayhem, and without this sparrow at your side!~
@445  = ~That does not mean I don't wish for it sometimes.~
@446  = ~True enough, and I never was very good at staying out of trouble anyway.~
@447  = ~Nonsense! If I was offered a normal life, I would take it in a heartbeat.~
@448  = ~Having you at my side makes it all worthwhile, my sparrow.~
@449  = ~I understand, my raven. I do not share your opinion, but I do understand.~
@450  = ~Hah! That does not surprise me in the least.~
@451  = ~That would be a terrible waste, if you ask me.~
@452  = ~Are you certain that is where they lead you? Does strengthening the taint also strengthen you, or must one be sacrificed for the benefit of the other, I wonder? And, more importantly, *would* you sacrifice one for the other?~
@453  = ~Absolutely. Power is power, Haer'Dalis, no matter how it's attained. Whatever the cost, I will pay it.~
@454  = ~I suppose that depends. If I must give up all of myself just to strengthen the taint, I wouldn't be gaining anything at all, would I?~
@455  = ~I can't answer that. It depends on the situation.~
@456  = ~And here I thought you'd appreciate a strong woman.~
@457  = ~I am equal parts cautious and curious to see if your words will hold true should you find yourself in a situation of such absolutes.~
@458  = ~I would imagine not.~
@459  = ~Very true. Perhaps one day we shall discover the answer together, aye?~
@460  = ~Ah, but I do! There is, however, a vast sea of differences between a strong fool and one whose wits and influence match the power of her body. I've seen far more of the former and almost none of the latter in my travels, my raven.~
@461  = ~Aye, that does sound difficult to bear, but I must admit, the duality is quite fascinating, my raven.~
@462  = ~I agree. It's interesting what I learn about myself, even from one day to the next.~
@463  = ~I don't see what's so fascinating.~
@464  = ~I find you fascinating as well, my sparrow.~
@465  = ~I hope your eyes are opened one day, my friend.~
@466  = ~Ah, my raven, my raven! These things you say are positively distracting! One day I shall find myself at the point of an enemy's sword, caught off guard whilst I daydreamed about your lips or the fragrance of your hair. On that day, you shall surely regret all your teasing, my dear friend.~
@467  = ~Come, you have sated my curiosity for the moment. This tale that is your life draws me in as few stories ever have. Glad I am to be in your company, my raven.~
@468  = ~This Imoen, who is she to you?~
@469  = ~I don't recall mentioning Imoen to you.~
@470  = ~She is my sister in all ways that matter.~
@471  = ~We're close, I suppose, though we bicker like girls tend to do.~
@472  = ~I'm very protective of her.~
@473  = ~I'm rather indifferent toward her, honestly.~
@474  = ~She's a brat, willful and constantly playing pranks.~
@475  = ~She's a weak coward.~
@476  = ~I don't want to talk about her.~
@477  = ~Perhaps you have not, but this sparrow has ears, my friend. Little birdies are ever anxious to chirp of you and all connected to you. So I ask again: who is Imoen?~
@478  = ~And why not, may I ask?~
@479  = ~I feel sad and helpless just thinking about her.~
@480  = ~Time wasted talking about her would be better spent finding her.~
@481  = ~Because it's none of your business.~
@482  = ~She is not my concern, nor my reason for pressing on, so I see no reason to discuss someone so unimportant.~
@483  = ~It's *her* fault I am here in the first place! If not for her making that scene in the Promenade, everything would be different right now!~
@484  = ~No, you may not. Let's move.~
@485  = ~As you will, my stubborn raven.~
@486  = ~Ah, so you do care for this wayward wren of yours.~
@487  = ~Of course I do! It's horrible to think of her locked up somewhere!~
@488  = ~If they'd taken me with her, I could have protected her, helped her escape or talked some sense into these Cowled Wizards...~
@489  = ~It's more that I feel I've failed my responsibilities, I suppose. I always looked out for her, and when she needed me, I failed her.~
@490  = ~She's annoying and often more trouble than she's worth, but I do miss her.~
@491  = ~Not really, but I don't wish ill on her either.~
@492  = ~Hah! No, I can't say that I do. Considering how cruel I've been to her over the years, it's quite strange that she doesn't run away screaming every time she sees me.~
@493  = ~Aye, in that I agree, but you do not truly know where she is, do you? You've only scraps of information and conjecture to guide you. For all you know, it's possible your Imoen is no longer caged at all. Either way, we shall discover the truth soon enough, I imagine.~
@494  = ~Or you could be locked in a dungeon beside her, or you could be dead. My raven, tormenting oneself with what might have been is a practice I thoroughly abhor, and it is one you should abandon.~
@495  = ~You have not given up the hunt for her, my raven, so I believe a declaration of failure is premature.~
@496  = ~I dare say that is a sentiment often expressed between siblings.~
@497  = ~I suppose I understand. She is not dear to you, but neither has she wronged you.~
@498  = ~Ah, then I have misunderstood.~
@499  = ~You have no love for this wayward wren of yours?~
@500  = ~Most certainly not. You'll understand if you ever get the chance to meet her. Her ceaseless chatter will make your ears bleed!~
@501  = ~I care nothing for what happens to her.~
@502  = ~Maybe. I think I'm just irritable right now, dealing with all of this mess. I didn't mean to imply that Imoen is nothing to me.~
@503  = ~That came out all wrong. Of course I care about her.~
@504  = ~Hmm... is this perhaps a hint, directed at this chittering sparrow? 'Tis one I shall ignore, of course.~
@505  = ~I wonder, what is it you chase then? Or whom? A question for another time, methinks.~
@506  = ~How would you feel, I wonder, if our path leads us to find that she is already dead, my raven?~
@507  = ~Oh, don't even say such a terrible thing! I cannot bear to think of it!~
@508  = ~I fear that may very well end up being the case, and each moment we delay I grow more anxious to find her.~
@509  = ~Then I will avenge her, in any and every way I can. That will be all I can do.~
@510  = ~If it happens like that, then it was meant to be. We all face death at some point.~
@511  = ~I wouldn't be surprised if that's exactly what we find. I don't think it would bother me all that much, to be honest.~
@512  = ~Wasting all this coin and effort, only to find her dead? I'd be furious, that's how I'd feel!~
@513  = ~I would feel nothing. Because that's exactly what she is to me.~
@514  = ~You may not wish to hear it, and it brings this sparrow no joy to say it, but it is as likely we will find her too late than find her in good health, my dear friend. You should prepare yourself for that very real possibility.~
@515  = ~Aye, I see you speak sincerely. It may come as little comfort, but I hope for a happy ending for you and yours, my friend.~
@516  = ~A pity she would not be able to see such just vengeance carried out in her memory, for it surely would be a sight to behold.~
@517  = ~That is an outlook most similar to my own, dear raven, and I commend you for it. Still I wonder, would you mourn her passing?~
@518  = ~Of course. Logically I understand the inevitability of death, but she is still a friend.~
@519  = ~A little, I suppose. We did grow up together, and though we fought often, I have fond memories of her.~
@520  = ~It may sound cold, but not really. We never did get along well.~
@521  = ~Not at all. It's not worth wasting a single tear over her.~
@522  = ~Ah, logic. Such a cold, unyielding bedfellow. This sparrow knows well what little comfort such thoughts bring in times of sorrow.~
@523  = ~'Tis a bleak, empty sentiment, indeed. I wonder if this Imoen would say the same of your demise.~
@524  = ~I cannot argue the frustration of wasting such resources for no reward, but it is quite telling that your concern is foremost directed toward coin and not your long lost companion.~
@525  = ~If your affection for this girl is any indication, you seem quite fond of your companions, these people whose paths have crossed yours, their lives intimately intertwined with your fate.~
@526  = ~I am fond of those who fight by my side, yes. You are my friends.~
@527  = ~It's hard not to become close to people who face death beside you, day after day.~
@528  = ~I try not to let emotional attachments overrun reason and necessity.~
@529  = ~Actually, that's not really accurate. Imoen is special to me, but I don't form friendships like that lightly.~
@530  = ~For some of my companions, I suppose that's true. I feel quite affectionate toward you, my sparrow.~
@531  = ~Attachment and sentiment is foolish and fleeting.~
@532  = ~Ah, that we are, that we are, my dear raven! 'Tis a pleasure to fight beside you, have no doubt of that.~
@533  = ~Aye, 'tis true. A certain level of trust is necessary when a person is guarding your back, and you guarding his. Let me assure you, this sparrow is glad to have you at his back.~
@534  = ~A difficult balancing act that is, my raven, and one I am curious to see how you handle.~
@535  = ~What would it take to become worthy of such special attention, I wonder? No, no, do not answer. This sparrow is only musing aloud.~
@536  = ~These feelings are mutual, my dear raven. It is one sentiment this actor need not feign.~
@537  = ~Such a jaded view for a woman so full of youth. Curious am I to see if these thoughts can be changed.~
@538  = ~If your distaste toward this girl is any indication, it seems you bear little concern for the companions at your back, the people who join you on your path.~
@539  = ~You're right, I don't much care for them, and I make no claim otherwise. And still they follow.~
@540  = ~I care enough to keep you fed and healed and not crushed beneath my boot heel. Nothing else matters.~
@541  = ~I'm not accustomed to dealing with the concerns of others, and I'm trying not to let emotional attachments overrun reason and necessity.~
@542  = ~No, it's nothing like that! I don't like Imoen, but she's just one person. There are others I care for, and I keep them close because they've earned my affection.~
@543  = ~That's because you are a leader, of course. Devotion to you and your cause has little to do with free will, and more to do with a... compulsion, of sorts. You are very easy to follow, my dark hound, even if your manner leaves something to be desired.~
@544  = ~And grateful am I that you tolerate this poor, frail sparrow! I cannot help but wonder at the feeling of being crushed 'neath your heel, but I shall resist the temptation to provoke you at present.~
@545  = ~Whatever comes, my raven, I enjoy these talks we have.~
@546  = ~I must say, the pure chaos that follows in your footsteps brings me endless delight. My raven, you are a harbinger of doom and destruction, and this sparrow simply cannot get enough of it!~
@547  = ~How dare you make light of such things! I loathe the death and violence that stalks me, and I would do anything to just be normal!~
@548  = ~I'm so glad you're enjoying yourself, because I'm certainly not.~
@549  = ~With all the constant violence and madness in my life, I hardly notice it anymore.~
@550  = ~It's certainly better than sitting around, wasting my life away and waiting for death to claim me.~
@551  = ~Hah, I love it, too! It's glorious to look around the battlefield once it's gone quiet, to see what I've survived and to witness the vengeance I've rained down upon my enemies!~
@552  = ~Breathe slowly lest your blood begin to boil with your righteous fervor. This sparrow thought you wiser than to work yourself into a panic over a simple compliment.~
@553  = ~Tsk, what fun is there in that, my dull raven?~
@554  = ~Indeed it is!~
@555  = ~Ah, my murderous hound, 'tis both terrifying and exhilarating to witness such bloodlust from a woman of your parentage. Speaking from the experience of a diverse collection of battlefields, this sparrow understands your meaning very well indeed.~
@556  = ~Why should we not take what we get with a smile? There is nothing you or I can do to change the past, and joy is preferable to sorrow, would you not say? Why then should we waste away our time wallowing in misery?~
@557  = ~I can agree with that.~
@558  = ~I refuse to find entertainment in the suffering of others!~
@559  = ~That's true, but it doesn't mean I have to celebrate the terrible things that happen to me.~
@560  = ~I'm far from miserable, but I'm far from jubilant as well. I'm content with being somewhere in the middle most of the time.~
@561  = ~I rather enjoy wallowing, thank you very much.~
@562  = ~I'm more interested in 'taking what I get' with a well-timed maniacal laugh. And as much death and destruction as I can get away with.~
@563  = ~Death is inevitable, unavoidable and necessary. What sense is there in fearing something that must be? Joy is better than sorrow, I say, so why then should we waste our time on misery?~
@564  = ~Exactly!~
@565  = ~It doesn't seem right to find entertainment in the suffering of others.~
@566  = ~I can't say I'm inclined to celebrate when all these terrible things keep happening to me.~
@567  = ~Actually, I rather enjoy wallowing in self pity.~
@568  = ~Making everyone else miserable is a joy in and of itself!~
@569  = ~Ah, how pleasing it is that we are of one mind at moments like this! Carry on, my delightful friend, carry on!~
@570  = ~Would be it better to pity others, then? What good does that do? Or mayhap you believe you have the power to help everyone in need of something. 'Tis a frightfully monumental task, attempting to right all the wrongs in the world.~
@571  = ~Yes, it is, but I'll do everything I can to bring kindness and compassion to the world, and nothing you say will change that.~
@572  = ~I do what I can, when I can. That's all I can do, but I'd like to think it makes a difference to some.~
@573  = ~Don't put words in my mouth! Just because I don't want to laugh at suffering doesn't mean I'm some righteous crusader either.~
@574  = ~When you put it that way, it does sound foolishly impossible.~
@575  = ~Sometimes I wonder why I keep you in my company.~
@576  = ~Oh, do not mistake me - this sparrow has no desire to see you change. 'Tis this banter we have that I enjoy, reveling in the act of arguing itself that brings me pleasure. If you wish to waste your efforts on a lost cause, who am I to deny you this?~
@577  = ~So you partake of neither the pleasure of worldly delight, nor the gratitude of acts of charity? I must wonder how you gain your enjoyments in this life. Perhaps someday you will show me, aye?~
@578  = ~Only you can answer this question. If you wish me to leave, all you need do is ask and I will seek my fortune elsewhere. Finding another godchild to follow about will not be easy, I admit...~
@579  = ~That is *exactly* what you should do! Worry and fear and sorrow, what do they gain you? Your eyes will perceive much when you learn to drink when you are starving, dance when the music has soured, and relax when the current drags you 'neath the sea!~
@580  = ~You are so strange, Haer'Dalis.~
@581  = ~I can't help what I feel! If something tragic happens, you can't tell me to shrug and laugh it off right away.~
@582  = ~An interesting philosophy, even if I don't ascribe to it myself.~
@583  = ~A fool's philosophy.~
@584  = ~Will you teach me how to see things as you do?~
@585  = ~Aye, you are neither the first nor the last to say so, I wager.~
@586  = ~My raven, my raven, we *are* what we feel, for feeling is the one thing we can control in a life that is decidedly out of control.~
@587  = ~It would be my delight and my pleasure, sweet raven. Spend time with this sparrow and you shall surely understand as I do. Come, take my arm and let us walk together for a time.~
@588  = ~What you describe sounds far closer to boredom than contentment. 'Tis a good thing you have this sparrow at your side, lest you bore yourself to eternal slumber.~
@589  = ~A pity in and of itself, my friend. You were made for better things, and mark my words, one day you will have no choice but to show your strength for what it is. When that day comes, you shall lose your mask of regrets and self sorrow forever, and I will not mourn its departure.~
@590  = ~Ah, Maiden of Chaos, how your words inspire! One day your actions will catch you up, I think, as they do us all, and I can only hope I am there to witness the madness of it firsthand.~
@591  = ~Let the consequences come! I'll beat back whatever comes, and grow stronger for every battle.~
@592  = ~It'll be interesting to see how things play out, that's for sure.~
@593  = ~I hope you'll be there, too.~
@594  = ~Ah, you flatter me with your attentions.~
@595  = ~Let us delay no longer. I wished only to express pleasure at your fair company, and 'twould not do to hinder your efforts by standing about.~
@596  = ~Your childhood must have been considerably exciting, my talented raven. If memory serves, and the rumors hold true, you hail from a place known as Candlekeep, aye? Tell me, what was it like?~
@597  = ~It was quiet, full of learning and books.~
@598  = ~It was bland. Colorless gray stone, dusty tomes, dull daily routines.~
@599  = ~It was the prison that locked me away from the world and my destiny.~
@600  = ~It was home. I know of no other way to describe it.~
@601  = ~It held vast knowledge and fascinating mysteries, believe it or not.~
@602  = ~I don't really want to talk about Candlekeep.~
@603  = ~Ah, so you enjoyed this home of yours then?~
@604  = ~Oh, yes! It was safe and comfortable. Nothing like the life I lead now.~
@605  = ~I suppose I enjoyed it then, but I wouldn't feel comfortable there anymore.~
@606  = ~It was okay, but I outgrew it and I've moved on.~
@607  = ~It was nothing special.~
@608  = ~Not really. I had chores, and Gorion was always yelling at me about something.~
@609  = ~Not at all! It can burn to the ground for all I care.~
@610  = ~I just really don't want to talk about it, Haer'Dalis.~
@611  = ~It seems you did not enjoy your childhood home.~
@612  = ~Definitely not! It can burn to the ground for all I care.~
@613  = ~No, I didn't. I had chores, and Gorion was always yelling at me about something.~
@614  = ~It was fine, but I outgrew it and I've moved on.~
@615  = ~On the contrary, it was safe and comfortable. Nothing at all like the life I lead now.~
@616  = ~Oh, but it was! It had you, after all, and even if it were naught but a barren waste, 'twould be something worth seeing just to catch a glimpse of fair <CHARNAME>.~
@617  = ~Flatterer.~
@618  = ~Now you're mocking me.~
@619  = ~Well, in truth it was safe and comfortable. Nothing like the life I lead now.~
@620  = ~Candlekeep was okay, but I doubt I'd feel comfortable there now.~
@621  = ~It's just that I had so many chores, and Gorion was always yelling at me about something.~
@622  = ~It can burn to the ground for all I care.~
@623  = ~As you wish, my dear stubborn friend.~
@624  = ~This sparrow is permitted a bit of flattery, is he not? 'Tis what bards do best, or so I've been told.~
@625  = ~Safety and comfort is what you desire from life, then? Truly, I had not expected that of you, my raven.~
@626  = ~And why not? I've been deprived of even the slightest bit of either for years now!~
@627  = ~I don't want it all the time. I'd be bored with a truly peaceful life, but a little of it from time to time would be welcome.~
@628  = ~I don't expect you to understand, Haer'Dalis. We are very different people.~
@629  = ~I'm not exactly sure what I desire from life, to be honest.~
@630  = ~No, I suppose that part of my life is behind me, isn't it? Only a child longs for what they can never have.~
@631  = ~I didn't mean it like that. It's just very different from what I have now.~
@632  = ~Oh, I must beg to differ, my dear one. I think you could find both in abundance if you'd but open your eyes. Certainly it would not be the same as that which you once had as a child, but comfort and safety are two things that come in a variety of forms.~
@633  = ~This sparrow understands well enough. Still, I think you could find both in abundance if you had a mind to look for them. Comfort and safety are two things that come in a variety of forms.~
@634  = ~Aye, that we are. Still, I would like to think that we are more alike than you believe.~
@635  = ~A child or a fool, my dear <CHARNAME>, and you are neither. Glad I am that you realize this.~
@636  = ~Aye, 'tis fascinating how we change as we grow and age, is it not? The things we once valued become unimportant, and that which we once scorned becomes our fondest desire.~
@637  = ~Hah, I can well imagine you as a mischievous youth, plotting your next misdeed and confounding the efforts of your guardians!~
@638  = ~Was there some particular pastime you enjoyed most? Some lesson or instruction that piqued your interest?~
@639  = ~I spent much of my time in meditation, learning to master my body, mind and spirit.~
@640  = ~Furthering my Art was, of course, always my passion.~
@641  = ~Oh, the typical diversions of every youth. Picking pockets, breaking into Gorion's desk to browse through his papers, stealing a coin or two when I felt like it.~
@642  = ~I was always sneaking around, getting into things. You know how it is.~
@643  = ~I was always drawn to the physical training. Discipline and combat were my passions.~
@644  = ~I was most inspired by tales of the wilds, and the people who championed the forest and her denizens.~
@645  = ~I was always uncomfortable within those stone walls, listening to monks drone on and on. All I desired was to disappear into the forest and listen to nature instead.~
@646  = ~I devoted myself to my god, training my body and mind to serve for the greater good.~
@647  = ~I spent much of my time in communion with my god or studying divine magic.~
@648  = ~I was usually busy studying this or that spell, or 'accidentally' frying the eyebrows off of unsuspecting monks.~
@649  = ~Most of my time was spent learning how to master my magic and use it safely.~
@650  = ~I enjoyed all of it, really. Learning is always worthwhile.~
@651  = ~It was long ago, Haer'Dalis. I don't really recall.~
@652  = ~Not really. All I wanted was to escape from my lessons as often as possible.~
@653  = ~I hated every second I was there.~
@654  = ~Surely there was something you enjoyed about it? Some lesson or instruction that piqued your interest?~
@655  = ~That does not surprise me in the least.~
@656  = ~Candlekeep certainly seems a fitting setting for those things. Surrounded by monks, it is no great wonder you grew to emulate them.~
@657  = ~Ah, but of course. Our muses are never to be denied, not even at a young age.~
@658  = ~I can easily imagine the mischief you made as a girl. What I would not give to have seen it for myself!~
@659  = ~Aye, swordplay has always been a passion of mine as well. There is nothing quite like the exhilaration it brings, is there?~
@660  = ~I do not fully understand what you mean, but of course I have only recently become familiar with these forests you value so highly. Perhaps you will share some of these tales with me someday, aye?~
@661  = ~The discomfort with walls I understand well enough, but I am still largely unfamiliar with these forests of the Prime. I would be most eager to learn to listen to nature as you do, if you had a mind to teach me.~
@662  = ~Ah, yes. And what a devoted servant you are, my armored hound.~
@663  = ~'Tis not a life this bard can ever imagine himself living, but it seems to suit you rather well.~
@664  = ~Ah, those lovely days of first cantrips, dazzling accidents and fizzling failures. Surely you do not miss them, amusing though they may be.~
@665  = ~Then I suppose I need not ask if you wish to ever see it again.~
@666  = ~No, I have no desire to see my prison again.~
@667  = ~I'm not sure, now that I think of it.~
@668  = ~Maybe it would be worth seeing again.~
@669  = ~Oh, I'd go back - to raze the place to the ground and dance on its ashes!~
@670  = ~When you put it that way, my dear raven, I understand well why you've no wish to return.~
@671  = ~Would you care to return to Candlekeep again someday, if only just to see it one more time?~
@672  = ~If I return to Candlekeep, it would be to stay. There is no other place I'd wish to call home.~
@673  = ~I would, though I couldn't be happy staying there for more than a visit. Still, it would be nice to see it again.~
@674  = ~I don't know. We've a lot to accomplish before I can even think about such things.~
@675  = ~No, I don't think I would. The past is done with, and should be left behind.~
@676  = ~Oh, I'd go back - to raze the place to the ground and dance on its ashes! After everything I put up with in that prison, it's the least they deserve!~
@677  = ~True, very true. I do not think I would mind seeing this place myself someday, this place where my raven learned to fly.~
@678  = ~Really? Well, maybe I'd make an exception if you really want to see it.~
@679  = ~You'd find it dull as dust, my sparrow, believe me.~
@680  = ~Well, enjoy yourself. I've no intention of returning.~
@681  = ~I don't care what you do.~
@682  = ~Of course, the chances of either of us surviving long enough to see such thoughts come to fruition is slim indeed. It would be a fascinating journey, to be sure.~
@683  = ~For any length of time, I've no doubt you would prove correct, my dear friend, but it is the excitement of new discovery that drives this sparrow.~
@684  = ~Now that would be a sight worth seeing, my hound. Mayhap this sparrow would dance in your shadow and bear witness to this chaos, if you'd have me.~
@685  = ~I'd love to have you at my side.~
@686  = ~Hah! As long as you stay out of my way, you should survive the destruction!~
@687  = ~Your help will not be needed, believe me.~
@688  = ~I doubt you'll survive long enough to have the chance.~
@689  = ~And I in turn adore being at your side. I have no words to express it, oddly enough.~
@690  = ~Oh, but what a glorious death, to be another casualty in your wake, my dark hound!~
@691  = ~Aye, but thinking about it sets this bard's mind all aflutter, my dark hound.~
@692  = ~Perhaps if you do journey to this Candlekeep, and if this sparrow still draws breath, I will join you in your journey to the past. 'Twould be most educational, I think, to see where my raven learned to fly.~
@693  = ~Why?~
@694  = ~If you wish, that would be fine.~
@695  = ~I'd rather you not, to be honest.~
@696  = ~I doubt we'll survive long enough to have the chance.~
@697  = ~To learn more of you and what made you into this glorious woman I see before me now, of course! As I am writing your story, it should come as little surprise that I wish to know of your past, aye?~
@698  = ~We have delayed long enough. You've many a quest before you, and I do you no favors by taking up your time.~
@699  = ~This life of adventure and travel is a true delight to this sparrow. Tell me, raven, do you enjoy it?~
@700  = ~I could not imagine my life any other way.~
@701  = ~It suits me well enough, I suppose.~
@702  = ~It doesn't really matter if I like it or not since it seems to be the life I'm destined to live.~
@703  = ~Not particularly, but I manage.~
@704  = ~I hate it, honestly. I'd give anything to have any other sort of life aside from this constant walking and sleeping on the ground.~
@705  = ~I see. Do not think I failed to notice that you didn't answer the question, my friend.~
@706  = ~Aye, that it does. Something in your eyes seems more alive when we are on the road and moving forward.~
@707  = ~Perhaps for now. Your love or loathing for this life will weigh heavily upon your choices, and your choices alters your path, just as your path alters your destiny, do you not think?~
@708  = ~A pity. Mere survival seems a frightfully pathetic way to live, if you do not mind me saying so.~
@709  = ~The life of the road comes with its share of discomforts, yet there is freedom to be found here that cannot be obtained whilst buried away behind walls and bars.~
@710  = ~'Tis the thrill of the unknown that appeals to this sparrow most, the tantalizing promise of mysteries and secrets waiting just 'round the next bend.~
@711  = ~Oh, I couldn't agree more! There's nothing more thrilling than rooting out a deep dark secret or discovering the truth of something that everyone was convinced couldn't be real.~
@712  = ~I like the traveling itself best. I never feel comfortable sitting in one place for too long.~
@713  = ~I love learning and knowledge, and while reading a book is informative, experiencing things firsthand is far better.~
@714  = ~For me, it's the people. We meet so many of them, and they're all so *different*. It's astonishing.~
@715  = ~It's the fighting that thrills me most. Blood, power, chaos - I love it all.~
@716  = ~Gee, what I like best is the bugs, dirt, lack of decent hygiene, torn clothing and tangled hair. Why, this life is just full to bursting with joyful perks!~
@717  = ~I don't like anything about it.~
@718  = ~Ah, we are birds of a feather, are we not my raven? Come, let us fly toward new adventures lest they escape whilst we stand about chattering like fools!~
@719  = ~I, too, feel much the same. It seems strange to me that some are so easily sated on a life that is stagnant and empty, caught up in a cage of their own making.~
@720  = ~It's horrible, I agree. Fools, all of them.~
@721  = ~I think they just fall into a rut and are either too afraid or too foolish to climb out of it.~
@722  = ~Life is hard, Haer'Dalis, and not everyone has the benefits we do to help themselves out of dire situations.~
@723  = ~It may seem empty to you, but I doubt everyone you scorn sees things that way. They have joy and contentment. It's just not the kind you desire.~
@724  = ~Either way the fault is theirs, is it not? I have little sympathy for those who refuse to help themselves, my raven.~
@725  = ~I can't argue that.~
@726  = ~Maybe, but not all lives can be generalized like that. Every situation is different.~
@727  = ~Well, I do. If there was more sympathy in the world, it'd be a better place all around.~
@728  = ~It isn't always a matter of refusal. Sometimes *nothing* a person does is enough to change their circumstances.~
@729  = ~Oh, whatever. Let's just get moving.~
@730  = ~Then we agree? Delightful!~
@731  = ~Aye, a fair point. But when something is true most of the time, it is often fair to assume it is true all of the time until proven otherwise.~
@732  = ~I suppose you're right.~
@733  = ~Maybe.~
@734  = ~That's a rather cynical view.~
@735  = ~Pity weakens those given it, my raven. I find it a bit unsettling that you've yet to understand that, given all you've seen and done.~
@736  = ~Ah, I sense you speak from experience. Forgive me, I did not mean to recall bad memories to your mind, my raven.~
@737  = ~As you would have it.~
@738  = ~But let us simply agree to disagree, my hound, and return to the road for now. Your enemies will not wait for us forever.~
@739  = ~Or a realistic one, if you are not a blind optimist.~
@740  = ~'Tis true enough, I suppose. Not all have magic and training at their disposal, or stalwart companions to guard their back. Still, if a man will not help himself, who has he to blame but himself?~
@741  = ~Himself, most likely, but not all lives can be generalized like that. Every situation is different.~
@742  = ~You know, if there was more sympathy in the world, it'd be a better place all around.~
@743  = ~It isn't always a matter of choice. Sometimes *nothing* a person does is enough to change their circumstances.~
@744  = ~Perhaps. Or perhaps they have created such elaborate delusions in their minds that even they believe that their boring, mundane existence is exciting and fulfilling. Perhaps they have no idea what their true potential could be because they are not willing to make the effort.~
@745  = ~Sounds believable to me.~
@746  = ~Are you saying there is only one way to be truly fulfilled? That the way you live your life is the only decent way?~
@747  = ~Perhaps, but it's impossible for you to know whether their feelings are genuine or not. Why err on the side of disbelief?~
@748  = ~Or maybe you're the one who's deluded. Maybe you've convinced yourself that your life is grand and wondrous, but really you're envious of the boring life of a turnip farmer.~
@749  = ~Certainly not! I argue only for the sake of argument, and surely that does not surprise you. This sparrow does adore debate, and with you it is especially rewarding.~
@750  = ~But, let us not waste more time on this for now. Your enemies await us, aye?~
@751  = ~Because it seems the more realistic take on such things.~
@752  = ~My word, but that *is* a fascinating thought... I am quite skilled at deception, and my talent for acting has wowed many... hah! Would that not be incredible, my dear raven? If I have spun a lie inside myself so elaborate that I've no chance of escape? That would be almost worth pretending it were true, if only to explore the notion further...~
@753  = ~Your wisdom humbles this bard, my friend. 'Tis truth you've spoken, yet so many seem content to let others experience life in their stead. How can a man consider himself learned if he has never done any of the things he reads of?~
@754  = ~Agreed. A second-hand account of something is worthless compared to the actual experience itself.~
@755  = ~Too many people are happy to delude themselves into believing they're not as worthless as they really are. Weak, arrogant fools, all of them.~
@756  = ~Not everyone has the ability to do more than absorb the retellings of others, though. A crippled man could not take up arms against his enemies like we can.~
@757  = ~Scholars have their uses. It's far easier for me to ask someone and receive an answer than to dig through a sea of books in hopes of chancing upon the information I seek.~
@758  = ~Everyone is entitled to live life the way they see fit, and if experiencing things through the adventures of others is what pleases someone, who am I to judge? Many people seem quite content living like that.~
@759  = ~I don't know, but we should get moving.~
@760  = ~Certainly, but would you rather trust the answers of a man who has sat on his rump his whole life, surrounded by books, or would you prefer the answers of one who has lived in the world, absorbing the knowledge you seek through personal experience?~
@761  = ~I see your point. The man with experience surely would give more sound advice.~
@762  = ~I don't think it's quite so black or white. Both lifestyles serve a purpose. I suppose it would depend on what sort information I sought.~
@763  = ~Are you saying there is only one way to lead a knowledgeable life? That they way you live is the only right way?~
@764  = ~'Tis true, the realms are full of shades of gray. Perhaps you have a point, my dear friend.~
@765  = ~People are fascinating to watch, that I admit. 'Tis astonishing how many are willing to aid or hinder you, as the case may be. So many people are drawn to you, regardless of their motivations. And regardless of yours.~
@766  = ~Those I trust at my back are my friends. I value them, and hopefully they value me as well.~
@767  = ~Those who come against me learn the foolishness of being my enemy. I do very little to encourage them, but if they're determined to fight, I'll not back down.~
@768  = ~It's something I've never gotten used to, if I have to be perfectly honest. I went from being a nobody, a child hidden away behind high stone walls, to a dangerous woman hunted by assassins, villains and heroes alike, my name and face recognized by so many.~
@769  = ~Everybody wants something, Haer'Dalis. That's a lesson I learned early on. Even if I don't know exactly what their motivation is, I can at least be certain they have one.~
@770  = ~I'd rather not think about it. Let's get moving.~
@771  = ~Your value to this sparrow grows with each passing moment, my friend, of that I can assure you.~
@772  = ~'Tis a stance I cannot help but admire, my fierce hound. Many choose to hide or bow to the will of those who come against them, but you... you do not falter, and it is a glorious sight indeed.~
@773  = ~Truly you are wise beyond your years, my raven. Even those who live hundreds of years often fail to ever learn that lesson.~
@774  = ~You dislike the attention?~
@775  = ~No, not at all! I just find it incredible to believe that I'm worth so much fuss.~
@776  = ~Not really. It's better than obscurity, that much is sure.~
@777  = ~A little. What I wouldn't give for some privacy now and again!~
@778  = ~Yes, very much so. I wish people would just mind their own business.~
@779  = ~The longer I know you, the less incredible I find it.~
@780  = ~I suppose I can imagine such scrutiny would be draining to you, perhaps. Still, the excitement and intrigue seems worth the cost of privacy, aye?~
@781  = ~My blood calls to me in battle as well, my hound, though I doubt with the same insistence as yours calls to you. Odd how a man feels most alive when his life is most in danger of being lost.~
@782  = ~Not odd at all. Clarity is found in moments of danger and violence, when only our instincts and training guide us.~
@783  = ~That is a bit strange.~
@784  = ~I always feel alive. What's the point of wasting life on anything but living?~
@785  = ~Mmm... have I ever told you how it thrills me when you wax philosophical, my dear raven? 'Tis most alluring.~
@786  = ~Hah! My poor raven with her muddied plumage... Your sharp tongue threatens to slice this bard clean in half!~
@787  = ~Is there nothing at all you enjoy about this life? Not a single thing?~
@788  = ~Well, I like you. So I suppose that's something.~
@789  = ~I suppose if I had to choose, I'd agree with you. There's nothing more thrilling than rooting out a deep dark secret or discovering something everyone was convinced couldn't be real.~
@790  = ~It's fair to say that I like traveling. I never feel comfortable sitting in one place for too long.~
@791  = ~It is fascinating to gather knowledge firsthand. Reading a book is informative, but experiencing things is far better.~
@792  = ~Sometimes I like people. We meet so many of them, and they're all so *different*. It's astonishing.~
@793  = ~Honestly, it's the fighting that thrills me most. Blood, power, chaos - I love it all.~
@794  = ~No, nothing at all.~
@795  = ~Well, aren't you a cheeky little minx? And here I was, not even fishing for a compliment. I assure you, my delightful raven, that I bask in your company as well.~
@796  = ~Alas, but that is a shame, considering your current lifestyle. I have hope that someday you will find something that makes all the torment worthwhile, my hound.~
@797  = ~What drove you from your fair home amongst the monks and books? Was it all not exciting enough to keep you captivated?~
@798  = ~I thought you'd have heard the stories about that by now.~
@799  = ~Gorion was concerned that I was no longer safe in Candlekeep, so he smuggled me out in the dead of night.~
@800  = ~Sarevok, whom I now know was one of the Children like myself, discovered my identity.~
@801  = ~It doesn't matter how I left. It's the past, and it's not worth talking about.~
@802  = ~Please don't ask me this.~
@803  = ~Aye, that I have. But as you well know, I prefer my sources untainted, and your version is of far more interest to me than the mumbled ramblings of some unskilled berk who dares call himself a teller of tales.~
@804  = ~We left because Gorion was concerned that I was no longer safe in Candlekeep, so he smuggled me out in the dead of night.~
@805  = ~It doesn't matter how I left. It's the past, and it's not worth thinking about.~
@806  = ~You'll have to be content with what you've heard. I've no interest in discussing it.~
@807  = ~That would be true if I were not in the process of detailing the story of your life. Surely you can tell me something, my raven.~
@808  = ~I've no interest in discussing it.~
@809  = ~My dear raven, you must know that I've no wish to bring you discomfort, but my curiosity longs for more. I only wish to tell your tale as honestly as possible. Surely you can tell me something.~
@810  = ~Must you be so stubborn! What can I do to persuade you, hmm? Anything you wish, it shall be done. Pride be damned, I will even beg on my knees if you so desire.~
@811  = ~Now that I have to see. On your knees, bard.~
@812  = ~No begging, but a kiss will do. And it better be a good one or I might change my mind.~
@813  = ~Carry my pack for the next two days, and you have a deal.~
@814  = ~You've nothing I want, Haer'Dalis, but if it means so much to you, I can tell you what you want to know. Gorion was concerned that I was no longer safe in Candlekeep, so he smuggled me out in the dead of night.~
@815  = ~This isn't something you can barter for. Let's just get moving.~
@816  = ~As you command! Dear raven, you are the first being to compel me to such acts of self degradation in nigh on two decades, and the first I yield to willingly. Will you do me the honor of answering my queries?~
@817  = ~Oh, you didn't really have to beg! Tsk, look how dirty your knees are now.~
@818  = ~Hah! I never tire of bringing proud men to their knees.~
@819  = ~Submissive is a good look for you.~
@820  = ~Yes, yes, since it's obviously so important to you.~
@821  = ~I don't find your display all that compelling. Let's just go.~
@822  = ~'Twas worth the sacrifice if it has convinced your lips to speak.~
@823  = ~I would take offense at such a comment were it not something I myself might say.~
@824  = ~I believe it would be a good look for you as well. Someday it would bring me great pleasure to find out for myself if I'm correct.~
@825  = ~Ah, surely you realize that this is not such a costly cost you've asked of me.~
@826  = ~(He catches your hands and dips his face to yours, pausing to give you a small, playful smile before he captures your mouth with his. His tongue softly brushes your lips, a low hum of approval vibrating in his chest. Before either of you can get fully drawn into the sensations, he pulls away, giving you one last chaste kiss on the corner of your mouth.)~
@827  = ~I presume that is adequate?~
@828  = ~Ah... ahem... very much so...~
@829  = ~I suppose it will do.~
@830  = ~We'll have to work on that later, but I'll answer your questions.~
@831  = ~You can do better than that.~
@832  = ~No, that just doesn't cut it, and I don't feel like talking anyway. Let's just get moving.~
@833  = ~But of course I can. It would not do to reveal all my tricks in one go, now would it?~
@834  = ~(sigh) At times this sparrow feels much more like a mule than a Doomguard, but if it will convince you to speak freely, then I agree.~
@835  = ~If you insist, my hound.~
@836  = ~Now have we an accord? Will you tell me of your exodus from the place you once called home?~
@837  = ~No. Now if you're quite finished, we need to get moving.~
@838  = ~Oh, how dramatic! What was it he feared exactly?~
@839  = ~At the time, I didn't know. All he said was that we were leaving to meet with some friends of his.~
@840  = ~I think he was paranoid.~
@841  = ~Dragging us out into the open got him killed! Who knows what might have happened if we'd just stayed safe in Candlekeep.~
@842  = ~Far too many things, it seems. I imagine the fool was thinking he should never have taken me in, especially considering what it cost him.~
@843  = ~Ah, and considering your sire, this brother of yours must have been seeking to destroy any competition you might pose, aye?~
@844  = ~A healthy edge of paranoia is far preferable to blind ignorance.~
@845  = ~Wondering on what might have been has never served any purpose but to drive us to lose sight of today, my raven. 'Tis worthless to dwell upon it.~
@846  = ~And what came of this escape? Clearly you were not taken from your nest and swept away to safety.~
@847  = ~We were attacked as we fled. Gorion gave his life to save mine. I... didn't want to leave him behind, but...~
@848  = ~Clearly not. We were ambushed, and Gorion forced me to flee.~
@849  = ~Sarevok found us. He butchered Gorion while I fled.~
@850  = ~Oh, the usual - the hulking villain ruined our perfect escape, smote a protagonist or two, and the heroine narrowly escaped in the chaos. Seems like old hat after this last year or two.~
@851  = ~My poor raven, take my hand. It does me ill to see you so conflicted over something you cannot change. All I can offer is the reassurance that this Gorion believed you worthy of the sacrifice, and you should not squander his faith in you.~
@852  = ~At the cost of his life, aye?~
@853  = ~Hah! But life with you is never dull, my raven! That surely must count for something, aye? It counts for much in my estimation.~
@854  = ~To have someone die for you must have been shocking, even if you were not close to your mage mentor. People die *because* of you all the time, but to have someone give of his life freely to see you live is rather... uncommon.~
@855  = ~I'd like to think it's not all that uncommon.~
@856  = ~I shouldn't have fled. I should have tried to save him.~
@857  = ~It should have been me. Why didn't he just hand me over?~
@858  = ~I've moved past it. Whatever I felt then doesn't matter.~
@859  = ~As much as I wanted to be rid of him and that prison he called home, I didn't necessarily want to see him butchered either.~
@860  = ~It was a fitting end for one who kept a godchild captive.~
@861  = ~I don't want to talk about it. Let's move.~
@862  = ~It is a common enough sentiment, that one is willing to die for this or that person or cause, but it is rarely seen in practice, my raven. Glad I am that you had one of the few willing to do so at your side on that fateful day.~
@863  = ~That would not have ended well, my raven.~
@864  = ~(sigh) That I cannot answer. Surely you would know better than any other aside from Gorion himself. For my part, I am glad he did not hand you over. I would still be in thrall to that insipid mage if it were so.~
@865  = ~That is a wise attitude, though I wish you would on occasion be more forthcoming.~
@866  = ~Aye, that I can well understand and appreciate, my raven. On occasion the price of freedom is higher than we ever expected.~
@867  = ~If that is so, then his folly has returned to him twofold, as it seems there is no end to those who wish to capture you, aye? Sarevok was but the first of many.~
@868  = ~Ah, but listen to me rambling on when there are battles to be fought and damsels to be saved and such. Know before we go that I am pleased your guardian mage found you worthy of his sacrifice. 'Tis a rare person who can inspire such devotion.~
@869  = ~Such sacrifices seem less frightening when it's someone we care for on the line. I would do whatever it takes to save you, even should it cost me my life.~
@870  = ~I don't want people to die for me, Haer'Dalis. I prefer the people I care about have a pulse.~
@871  = ~I never asked to be a leader. I don't know why people follow me.~
@872  = ~Are you saying you'd die for me?~
@873  = ~I don't need people to die for me. I can take care of myself.~
@874  = ~Better the lesser folk than me. Let others weaken my enemies, and I will strike when they're nice and soft.~
@875  = ~I...~
@876  = ~I surely hope this urge of yours is one that is never tested. Death comes to us all, and I welcome it with open arms. I am very aware of your mortality, but your demise is not something I wish to witness, most certainly not at my expense.~
@877  = ~Hah! None can escape death, my sweet raven, but on the whole, 'tis a sentiment I cannot help but share. Dead friends are simply so much less entertaining, aye?~
@878  = ~I hope someday you see what others see in you, and I hope that day comes sooner rather than later. For all our sake.~
@879  = ~Is that not what I declare each time I draw my weapon in your defense?~
@880  = ~Then this sparrow has to wonder, whatever do you need me for?~
@881  = ~'Tis a pragmatic approach, I suppose. I've known a number of tanar'ri with similar views. It certainly suits the life you lead, my hound.~
@882  = ~Hmm... Let me see, where should I...? Ah-ha!~
@883  = ~Tell me, my raven - singing or dancing?~
@884  = ~I'm sorry, what?~
@885  = ~Is that a quill in your hand? What... how...?~
@886  = ~You're taking notes? You're taking notes. Why am I even surprised?~
@887  = ~Wonderful. More insightful questions from the brilliant bard.~
@888  = ~I'm in no mood for your games, Haer'Dalis.~
@889  = ~This sparrow learned long ago that a traveling writer must chronicle his thoughts as they come to him lest they drift away and be lost forever. 'Tis not always an easy task, what with monsters flying in our faces at every turn, smudging the ink and rumpling the parchment, but 'tis the effort that counts, aye?~
@890  = ~Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, my hound.~
@891  = ~Games? *Games*? I'll have you know, I take my writing very seriously! Shame on you.~
@892  = ~I have but a few questions, then I shall leave you be. Choose honestly, whatever first comes to your mind. Instinct, my raven, instinct!~
@893  = ~Again, singing or dancing?~
@894  = ~I enjoy both well enough.~
@895  = ~Singing, I suppose.~
@896  = ~I prefer dancing.~
@897  = ~Neither.~
@898  = ~*sigh*~
@899  = ~I'm not answering your questions.~
@900  = ~I myself am much the same, though I think perhaps I feel the urge to move my feet more often than lift my voice.~
@901  = ~Aye? You shall have to sing for me someday. Or mayhap you simply enjoy listening to song, in which case this sparrow shall have to tune his instrument for your entertainment more often.~
@902  = ~Splendid! Promise we shall share a dance at our next opportunity, my friend.~
@903  = ~Poetry or prose?~
@904  = ~I like all forms of writing.~
@905  = ~Poetry.~
@906  = ~Prose, probably.~
@907  = ~I hate reading. And listening. And words.~
@908  = ~That depends on my mood.~
@909  = ~I'm warning you...~
@910  = ~A true lover of literature, are you? I admit, I am surprised you have time for words at all, what with the constant and violent interruptions you entertain daily.~
@911  = ~Truly? I did not think you the poetic sort. Fascinating. This sparrow delights to learn new things about you, raven.~
@912  = ~This sparrow prefers prose as well, though a finely wrought verse is pleasant from time to time.~
@913  = ~Ah. A pity, though perhaps not entirely surprising.~
@914  = ~As do many other things besides, methinks.~
@915  = ~War or peace?~
@916  = ~There cannot be one without the other.~
@917  = ~War, absolutely.~
@918  = ~Peace. Would that I could obtain it.~
@919  = ~Sometimes I like a good fight, sometimes I enjoy a rest.~
@920  = ~Damn it, Haer'Dalis!~
@921  = ~Indeed you have me there, my clever one. To loathe one and love the other may perhaps be our instinct, but without the one to hate, there would be none to adore.~
@922  = ~As expected.~
@923  = ~You might find it less out of reach should you choose to rethink the current direction of your life, my dear. Just a suggestion.~
@924  = ~Ah, your moods, your moods! Greater riddles exist not than the whims of fair <CHARNAME>!~
@925  = ~Oh, very well! I see you shall not be content till I have quit the field. Ignore your wounded sparrow as he flutters off to brood in sullen silence.~
@926  = ~The glass: half-empty or half-full?~
@927  = ~Empty, obviously.~
@928  = ~Full, of course.~
@929  = ~That depends on what we're talking about.~
@930  = ~If it's booze, and it's in front of me, it's completely empty.~
@931  = ~But... I'm not even thirsty...~
@932  = ~Huh?~
@933  = ~Tsk, 'tis hardly as bad as all that, though I won't argue that things are ill more often than they are fair in your company. Uh... not to say I would wish to be without it... moving on!~
@934  = ~My raven, you amaze me. I know not if your optimism will live through whatever trials await you on this winding road of yours. Entropy dictates that it will not last, but this Doomguard could almost mourn the passing of such a delicate and beautiful thing.~
@935  = ~Ah, but I ramble on like a mad old fool! Forgive me.~
@936  = ~Meaning your view of each subject is, well... subjective? Hah, I suppose that's sensible, and perhaps not entirely different from my own thoughts.~
@937  = ~I wonder if you will believe me if I say alcohol is not the answer to everything...~
@938  = ~That is...~
@939  = ~My raven, I cannot always discern when you jest and when you speak sincerely. And as receiving confirmation of the latter would terrify your poor sparrow, let us simply move on.~
@940  = ~Hah! This expression you wear, it is quite telling, my darling raven.~
@941  = ~Day or night?~
@942  = ~I don't prefer one over the other.~
@943  = ~I enjoy the daytime.~
@944  = ~Night is where I'm most comfortable.~
@945  = ~They're equally unpleasant.~
@946  = ~Truly? I find that difficult to believe, though I'll not press you on it. I've yet to meet a single person who does not favor one above the other. Unique, are you?~
@947  = ~'Tis brighter, livelier, *vibrant* 'neath this sun of yours. Yet still I find myself enraptured by your pale moon and her blanket of stars. To each their own, of course.~
@948  = ~Aye, myself as well. 'Tis too peaceful, too calm at times, but there is something captivating about your pale moon and her blanket of stars.~
@949  = ~Be wary, my friend. At times you sound suspiciously like a woman who grasps for death with both hands. It comes for us all, raven. There is no need to rush the inevitable.~
@950  = ~Yesterday or tomorrow?~
@951  = ~Yesterday.~
@952  = ~Tomorrow.~
@953  = ~Today.~
@954  = ~It's all the same.~
@955  = ~Mourning for the past? Unfortunate.~
@956  = ~Do let this sparrow know when your tomorrow arrives, aye?~
@957  = ~Ah... such a sweet reply is music to this bard's ears!~
@958  = ~Well, I suppose one might see it that way.~
@959  = ~Indoors or outside?~
@960  = ~Inside is nice. But so is outside.~
@961  = ~Indoors, for the most part.~
@962  = ~I'd have to say outside.~
@963  = ~Depends on what I'm doing. Or what I want to be doing.~
@964  = ~Bugs flying around everywhere, monsters in caves, drunks in taverns, annoying bards at my elbow - it's terrible everywhere.~
@965  = ~So, wherever you are, there you're pleased to be? I like that.~
@966  = ~'Tis difficult to be certain, aye? Not all ins are created equal.~
@967  = ~The Prime has many a fascinating and wondrous scenery, that I will admit.~
@968  = ~True, true, though when you put it that way, this sparrow longs for specifics.~
@969  = ~Careful with that razor tongue of yours, hound. 'Twould be a pity if you cut yourself.~
@970  = ~Beauty or wisdom?~
@971  = ~A lot of both, please.~
@972  = ~Beauty.~
@973  = ~Wisdom.~
@974  = ~Neither matter in the long run. Both eventually fade away.~
@975  = ~A pleasant balance of the two would be nice.~
@976  = ~Who cares?~
@977  = ~Hah! A revealing answer, oh greedy one. 'Tis often difficult enough to deal with a lovely simpleton or a homely genius. Join them as one, and I cringe to think of the likely outcome.~
@978  = ~Some would say that is a foolish choice, but not I. And I commend you for your honesty.~
@979  = ~A solid and perhaps predictable answer. A pity I must take your word alone. To see you faced with the consequences of such a choice would be intriguing.~
@980  = ~Indeed they do. But that should not diminish their usefulness in the meantime, should it?~
@981  = ~Aye, nice it would be. And mundane. And dull.~
@982  = ~I do, obviously. What a silly question.~
@983  = ~Drunk or sober?~
@984  = ~Depends on the circumstances.~
@985  = ~Drunk.~
@986  = ~Sober.~
@987  = ~Haven't we covered this already?~
@988  = ~Not enough of the former and too much of the latter right now.~
@989  = ~Hopefully you mean drunk at bedtime and sober into battle, and not the other way 'round.~
@990  = ~I cannot imagine how much coin you'd have if you did not drink it away.~
@991  = ~Always? Constantly? Under any and all circumstance? I shall be utterly forthright - the very thought frightens me.~
@992  = ~You are not perchance drunk at this very moment, are you?~
@993  = ~I am certain that shall be remedied at your earliest opportunity, my dear friend.~
@994  = ~Leading or following?~
@995  = ~I don't mind either.~
@996  = ~Leading, absolutely.~
@997  = ~Not having to *always* lead would be a relief.~
@998  = ~I wish I could simply follow.~
@999  = ~There's no option to sit on my rump all day?~
@1000 = ~Really? That is a truly rare quality, my raven.~
@1001 = ~I expected as much. Glad I am, then, that you've been given this role so freely.~
@1002 = ~I imagine it would be, aye.~
@1003 = ~Allow this sparrow to most heartily assure you that following is almost never a simple thing. Especially when one follows you, my raven.~
@1004 = ~Tsk, you cannot pretend you would be satisfied with such a life. You are far more than that.~
@1005 = ~Truth or lies?~
@1006 = ~Both have their uses.~
@1007 = ~The truth is always better than a lie.~
@1008 = ~Lies are easier.~
@1009 = ~It's difficult to tell one from the other most times.~
@1010 = ~Ah, a true manipulator at heart, are you? 'Tis not a trait for which I can judge anyone, as I am likely guiltier than most in that regard.~
@1011 = ~Is it? I myself have not found this true. Or perhaps you are lying now in swearing by the truth. Hmm...~
@1012 = ~They are. Not always better, not always correct or fair, but I have indeed always found them easier. Lies have a mind of their own.~
@1013 = ~Ah, my raven, 'tis not as difficult as all that. When a person has convinced himself that the lie is true, or that the truth is false, only then can the riddle be difficult to unravel.~
@1014 = ~Hmm... Let us leave off for now, fair friend. There is more I would ask, but my well has run dry and I fear I've poked a few holes in my poor, misused parchment. I thank you for entertaining your humble sparrow's game.~
@1015 = ~Much we have said to one another, my raven, yet I do not believe I have heard the truth of how you ended up in these lands of Amn.~
@1016 = ~But you have heard something?~
@1017 = ~To be honest, I really don't know how I ended up in Amn.~
@1018 = ~I was captured by a mage, though I don't know how or why.~
@1019 = ~We were attacked and overrun. I woke up, perhaps days or weeks later, in a cell.~
@1020 = ~This isn't something I want to talk about.~
@1021 = ~Aye, bits and pieces. Some believe you were carried here by foul magic, whilst other claim you've come to escape some enemy in Baldur's Gate. Regardless, nothing I've heard has the full ring of truth.~
@1022 = ~We were attacked and overrun. I woke up in a cell, perhaps days or weeks later.~
@1023 = ~Of course you don't, but you very well should.~
@1024 = ~Oh? Why is that?~
@1025 = ~No. I shouldn't.~
@1026 = ~Yes. You should.~
@1027 = ~And why is that exactly?~
@1028 = ~I'm warning you, it's not wise to annoy me.~
@1029 = ~I consider myself warned, and I am willing to risk your wrath. What do you intend to do with me, oh frightful hound? Will you raise your hand against your sparrow? Will you have me bound and tortured?~
@1030 = ~Why is this so important to you?~
@1031 = ~I will kill you if you don't shut your mouth.~
@1032 = ~Bound and tortured sounds fantastic right about now.~
@1033 = ~How about I just cut out that gilded tongue of yours and have done with it?~
@1034 = ~I'll ignore you. That's the worst I can do to someone like you.~
@1035 = ~If you will not honor my silence, then you may feel free to leave.~
@1036 = ~Oh, but that does sound serious. (sigh) As you wish then, my dark-hearted raven.~
@1037 = ~Ah, such taunts leave me trembling with anticipation! You tease me with such false promises, cruel raven. Will there be a feather involved? I have a weakness for feathers.~
@1038 = ~What? I most certainly didn't mean to imply anything untoward!~
@1039 = ~I should have guessed you would twist my meaning.~
@1040 = ~Who says my promises are false?~
@1041 = ~Feathers, you say? What if I promise to bind you to my bed this night and torment you for hours, hmm?~
@1042 = ~Oh, enough of this! I don't want to talk!~
@1043 = ~Is that a blush I spot on your cheeks, my sweet friend? 'Tis most becoming.~
@1044 = ~Indeed you should have.~
@1045 = ~Hmm... I shall have to test the depth of your sincerity, and soon.~
@1046 = ~Then I would consider myself twice teased, and doubly intrigued.~
@1047 = ~Oh, fine, fine. I shall simply walk behind with my head hung low in sorrow. Alas, woe is me!~
@1048 = ~Oh, what pain your words cause! You truly know the surest way to pierce this sparrow's heart. Aye, I shall retreat and leave you to your thoughts then.~
@1049 = ~You wish your sparrow happiness, do you not? Surely you would not deny me what I so dearly desire. All I wish is to know you better.~
@1050 = ~You did not come here of your own free will?~
@1051 = ~A caged bird were you? My, but that sounds grim. Who was this jailor of yours? Some enemy from your past seeking vengeance?~
@1052 = ~Irenicus was his name, and he claimed he was trying to open up the true potential of my blood.~
@1053 = ~He called himself Irenicus, and he was truly a madman. I still don't know what he wanted from me.~
@1054 = ~Irenicus may have had me at his mercy once, but I swear the next time we meet, he will be on his knees begging for mercy.~
@1055 = ~Irenicus was just another fool looking to take advantage of my power.~
@1056 = ~He was a stranger to you, then? Your reputation must have preceded you for him to purposely seek your capture. What did he do to you, my raven?~
@1057 = ~He tortured me.~
@1058 = ~He spent hour upon hour, day after day bringing me to the brink of death, only to heal me and begin again.~
@1059 = ~He experimented on me. Cast spells on me, struck me, cut me. His dungeon was filled with tormented souls.~
@1060 = ~He tried to break me, but I cannot be broken and I would give him nothing.~
@1061 = ~I... this is too much. I can't speak of it.~
@1062 = ~How?~
@1063 = ~Torture.~
@1064 = ~My dear <CHARNAME>, it burns me to see the pain in your eyes. I know that look well, for it is one I've seen in my own mirror on occasion. I shall not force you to relive it any further.~
@1065 = ~There must have been a purpose to such abuse. Did he question you, or did you have something he... Oh...~
@1066 = ~Ah, I see. I believe I understand.~
@1067 = ~What do you mean?~
@1068 = ~My blood, Haer'Dalis. He wanted the power of my sire.~
@1069 = ~All he ever asked me was if I knew the true power I could have once my potential was unleashed.~
@1070 = ~It makes no difference. He thought he could control me, and he will die for what he's done.~
@1071 = ~I will find him, and he will tell me exactly what it is he sought from me.~
@1072 = ~You will always be hunted because of what you are, won't you? There is power in your blood, and many covet such power. To be half-god, it is an irresistible lure to some, my raven.~
@1073 = ~To someone like you as well?~
@1074 = ~I never asked to be born of a god.~
@1075 = ~I'd give it all up to just be a normal mortal woman.~
@1076 = ~Let them come. I'll cut them down as I always have.~
@1077 = ~Each person I strike down makes me stronger. I don't fear these pathetic fools, not even Irenicus.~
@1078 = ~Oh, I am drawn to you, that much I cannot deny, but 'tis not for power that I am drawn in. It is something else altogether, methinks.~
@1079 = ~Do you wonder if he knew something you did not? If there truly is a way to access the taint in your blood and make yourself more powerful?~
@1080 = ~I wonder that, but he has proved himself evil. I would never want or trust anything he offered me.~
@1081 = ~Whatever knowledge he has, I will take it for myself when we find him.~
@1082 = ~I don't care, frankly. All I want is Imoen back safely, and then we'll get as far from the raving madman as possible.~
@1083 = ~That doesn't make a lot of sense. Why would he want to make *me* stronger? Obviously he was after something for himself.~
@1084 = ~I don't know.~
@1085 = ~I cannot fault such logic. I imagine it is difficult to take the word of one who has done you such ill. Still, if he has knowledge that could aid you somehow, it would be a pity to see it lost.~
@1086 = ~How far will be far enough? I daresay the only way to make yourselves safe is to make sure this man can never be a threat to you again.~
@1087 = ~Perhaps he needed to strengthen you first before he could take what he needed. Or perhaps he simply never anticipated you would free yourself, and was thus free to do with you whatever he wished.~
@1088 = ~I suppose it doesn't really matter. It is quite possible you will never see your captor again.~
@1089 = ~How is it you won your freedom, if I may ask?~
@1090 = ~Imoen said there was some sort of fighting or disturbance, and she managed to slip out when she found her cell unlocked.~
@1091 = ~It was horrible. We had to fight our way out through all manner of abominations in that sick man's dungeon.~
@1092 = ~Irenicus had other enemies who provided enough distraction for us to escape in the chaos.~
@1093 = ~No one can hold me for long, Haer'Dalis. Irenicus was a fool to think he could cage me.~
@1094 = ~It's such a blur. I hardly remember anything.~
@1095 = ~That seems rather convenient, aye? I do not mean to slight your success, but this sparrow cannot help but wonder if you were perhaps aided in your escape by your very captor himself.~
@1096 = ~I have seen my fair share of torture and dungeons in my years, raven, and I never cease to be amazed at how varied and twisted they can be.~
@1097 = ~May your determination always prove enough to win your freedom, my fearless raven.~
@1098 = ~I have heard of the scene in which you played a supporting role when you arrived in the Promenade. That was the climax of your escape, aye? 'Tis truly an astounding set of events, my dear friend. This sparrow is a bit saddened that he was not there to experience it firsthand at your side.~
@1099 = ~Help me get Imoen back, and I'm sure you'll see equally astounding things along the way.~
@1100 = ~It would have been nice to have you around back then.~
@1101 = ~If you'd been there, it's likely you'd have ended up dead.~
@1102 = ~Things like this happen to me all the time. Stick around and see for yourself.~
@1103 = ~Bah, you'd just have gotten in my way.~
@1104 = ~Talking about this is wearying. Let's get moving.~
@1105 = ~I would not want it any other way, <CHARNAME>.~
@1106 = ~Ah, 'tis pleasant to know one's presence is wanted, is it not?~
@1107 = ~Perhaps, but to see such things as you did would be worth the risk in this bard's estimation.~
@1108 = ~But that is what I'm good for, aye? Getting underfoot?~
@1109 = ~I thank you for your patience, my raven. 'Twas a most enlightening tale.~
@1110 = ~What will you do, my raven, once yon villain is slain and the fair damsel rescued?~
@1111 = ~Asking about the future? That seems rather unusual for you, Haer'Dalis.~
@1112 = ~I haven't really thought about it much.~
@1113 = ~I plan to find a way to lead a normal life.~
@1114 = ~I'll push on toward my destiny, of course, cutting a swath through the sea of enemies who stand in my way.~
@1115 = ~That's none of your business.~
@1116 = ~It goes against this sparrow's nature to plan and scheme for anything long term. It spoils the mystery of what is to come and implies that there is in fact a future to contemplate. We both well know time is flying away even as we speak.~
@1117 = ~That does not stop me from being curious of your mind, however. You are no Doomguard, and I assume you have hopes and dreams like any other creature of the Prime.~
@1118 = ~I think you and I are far more alike than you assume.~
@1119 = ~I'll push on toward my destiny, of course.~
@1120 = ~Oh, do you think so?~
@1121 = ~As you said, time is fleeting. What's the purpose of wasting what time I do have wondering on what might be? Or on what might have been, for that matter.~
@1122 = ~I try to experience each moment as it happens, never letting myself be distracted from the now.~
@1123 = ~The only reward I've gotten from hoping and dreaming is disappointment. If I don't set myself up for heartbreak, I can't be heartbroken.~
@1124 = ~No, not really.~
@1125 = ~I do. You'll just have to find out for yourself if it's true.~
@1126 = ~Aye, that rings true for myself as well. Perhaps you speak truly, my dear raven. Perhaps we are more akin than I thought.~
@1127 = ~Such focus would require a tremendous amount of self-discipline. 'Tis a wonder you have time to enjoy the moment, for all the effort you must spend attempting to focus on it.~
@1128 = ~Such a jaded view cannot do your heart much good, my poor hound. How can you know satisfaction if you have never known disappointment? How can you relish pleasure if you have never felt pain? They are two sides of the same coin, and one cannot be sacrificed without the loss of the other as well.~
@1129 = ~Oh, we have things in common, my silly raven. This act itself proves it.~
@1130 = ~Such a lovely tease you are. I look forward to discovering the truth.~
@1131 = ~There has been little time for contemplation, 'tis true. Mayhap thinking of what comes after will only make things more difficult, despite the claims of some that goals provide motivation.~
@1132 = ~I must assume that by 'normal' you mean a life which is not drenched in violence, chaos and the blood of countless men and women. Forgive me for saying so, but I find it hard to imagine you in any other sort of life.~
@1133 = ~Meaning continued violence, chaos and murder, I assume. Truly, I find it difficult to imagine you in any other sort of life.~
@1134 = ~Of course not, and 'tis likely as not that I will not live to see your future play out, but I am curious nonetheless.~
@1135 = ~Perhaps I assume much, but it seems to me that you will never be permitted a peaceful existence. Your father's gift of life may or may not have destined you for any path in particular, but it does seem to have barred some from you, aye?~
@1136 = ~I've done much in my life that people declared impossible. I refuse to accept that there's something I cannot do.~
@1137 = ~I'll never know if I don't try. If I fail or things don't work out, then I'll deal with it then.~
@1138 = ~That certainly seems true. I can't even see a few days respite without being attacked or captured or asked to perform some task or another.~
@1139 = ~I wish it weren't true, but I know in my heart that I will never find peace in the way many people do.~
@1140 = ~It doesn't matter. I love this life I live now, and I've no intention of seeing it change.~
@1141 = ~The power in my blood is well worth any sacrifice.~
@1142 = ~Ah, my hound! I have yet to discover if this stubbornness of yours is a virtue or a vice. I suspect it shall leave you disappointed one day.~
@1143 = ~It won't.~
@1144 = ~I'm willing to risk that.~
@1145 = ~You're probably right.~
@1146 = ~I'm used to disappointment. I'll get over it and move on, stronger than before.~
@1147 = ~Your resolve worries me and inspires me in turns. More often than not I cannot comprehend your mind, yet I find myself wishing that your hopes are fulfilled. 'Tis strange.~
@1148 = ~Is that a good thing or a bad thing?~
@1149 = ~But you like it, my sparrow, or we'd not be having this conversation at all.~
@1150 = ~Don't try to comprehend me, then. Just accept me.~
@1151 = ~I don't care what you think of me.~
@1152 = ~We've chatted long enough. Let's move.~
@1153 = ~Truly, I do not yet know. At times I feel as if I stand on a precipice, the winds of your spirit pushing and pulling at me. All people I've ever known have a place, a perfect fit within the chaos of our crumbling realms, but when I look upon you...~
@1154 = ~Ah, do not mind this sparrow. 'Tis a maudlin spell descends upon me, and it shall pass soon enough.~
@1155 = ~Fair temptress, you know me well indeed. These talks we have are a true delight, and I would not wish to be without them. Or without you.~
@1156 = ~Acceptance is a strange beast, <CHARNAME>. Those who obsess over it rarely give it to others, and those who never mention it often show it in abundance.~
@1157 = ~That aside, I could no more reign in my curiosity than cease to breathe of my own volition. I fear you will have to endure my attempts at comprehension for at least a bit longer.~
@1158 = ~As you wish.~
@1159 = ~Fine. I'm sure I'll survive somehow.~
@1160 = ~I'd rather you just leave me alone.~
@1161 = ~Your prodding has gotten a bit tiresome, bard.~
@1162 = ~You are a strong woman, <CHARNAME>. I shall endeavor to make my curiosity less than life threatening.~
@1163 = ~Nonsense. If you gained no pleasure from our interactions, you'd have long ago silenced me. 'Tis something you are quite good at, this ability to forever silence those you do not wish to hear.~
@1164 = ~All evidence to the contrary.~
@1165 = ~Enough standing about. There is blood to be spilt, aye?~
@1166 = ~Aye, 'tis something you clearly have much experience with, as do I. The more I learn of our differences, the more alike we seem at times, my raven.~
@1167 = ~Ah, though I oft love hearing those words, in this I find myself hoping you prove me wrong. 'Tis strange how you affect this sparrow at times.~
@1168 = ~Stop trying to get inside my mind. Just accept me for who I am.~
@1169 = ~I don't care what you think.~
@1170 = ~I admire your conviction, and even more your ability to accept the possibility of failure. You are a rare creature, my raven, and a woman who confounds and delights this sparrow.~
@1171 = ~Hah! Ah, my poor hounded hound. 'Twould be tiring to be sought after overmuch, and you are so very often sought and begged and cajoled that it's a wonder you've not gone mad from the buzzing of berks in your ears!~
@1172 = ~I'm strong enough to handle it.~
@1173 = ~It's not all that bad. Things could be worse.~
@1174 = ~Who says I'm not mad?~
@1175 = ~It's irritating, but sometimes the reward is worth the annoyance of listening to fools whine in my ear.~
@1176 = ~I'd slaughter them all to the last if I could. Pathetic fools.~
@1177 = ~Aye, that you are, my dear raven. That you are.~
@1178 = ~And that is a constant truth. Still, I am unsure if I find your acceptance refreshing or depressing. Perhaps a bit of both, aye?~
@1179 = ~If you are, 'tis a most alluring breed of madness, this sort within you. Is there room for this sparrow in that mad mind of yours?~
@1180 = ~On second thought, I'm pretty sure you're the crazy one here.~
@1181 = ~Yes! Let us be madmen together, my sparrow!~
@1182 = ~You wouldn't fit in with the voices in my head, I'm afraid.~
@1183 = ~Lovely, am I?~
@1184 = ~There's nothing worse than a bard flinging false flattery.~
@1185 = ~A mercenary but prudent perspective. This sparrow heartily approves.~
@1186 = ~Ah, I should write myself a note to remind myself never to ask you for a favor...~
@1187 = ~You are not the first to reach that very same conclusion.~
@1188 = ~True. 'Twould be difficult to be heard over the din I am certain goes on within a godchild's head.~
@1189 = ~'Tis only the truth! This bard would not lie to you, would he?~
@1190 = ~Glad I am that you realize this, though it wounds me to know it brings you pain. 'Twould be far better for you to find joy in the life you do have instead of longing for one you know will never come.~
@1191 = ~Ah, such passion and conviction calls to this sparrow's heart! So alike at times are you and I, that I muse we were cut from the same mold.~
@1192 = ~'Tis a powerful declaration you make, my fierce hound. There are some sacrifices I would never make, and I have gladly sacrificed much in my years.~
@1193 = ~That's the difference between you and me. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to obtain power.~
@1194 = ~Our philosophies are very different, so it's no big surprise that we don't agree on this.~
@1195 = ~Perhaps you're right. Maybe not *any* sacrifice.~
@1196 = ~I wouldn't sacrifice you, if it's any consolation.~
@1197 = ~You think I would so easily reveal my innermost secrets? Tsk, I am disappointed.~
@1198 = ~Aye, perhaps you speak truly. I have very little interest in power. It is a fleeting thing that never lasts overlong, yet it is a trickster as well. Power fools its followers into believing there is truth found in its teachings, but in the end, there is little satisfaction in dust and ashes.~
@1199 = ~Even gods die, <CHARNAME>. Your own sire should have taught you that lesson.~
@1200 = ~Glad I am that you are willing to see some sense, at least.~
@1201 = ~Ah, what a sweet sentiment! Though I do not think death will evade me simply because you do not crush me beneath your heel yourself.~
@1202 = ~I am curious, my raven. This country of Amn, would you say that it agrees with you?~
@1203 = ~I rather like it, yes.~
@1204 = ~It's decent, I suppose.~
@1205 = ~Eh, it's all the same everywhere.~
@1206 = ~Not really, no.~
@1207 = ~It's horrible.~
@1208 = ~I can't say I'm particularly fond of their views on magic.~
@1209 = ~I have no interest in discussing this with you.~
@1210 = ~Please?~
@1211 = ~Fine. Yes, I rather like Amn.~
@1212 = ~Oh, very well. It's decent, I suppose.~
@1213 = ~There's no point discussing it. All places are the same.~
@1214 = ~I don't really like Amn, no.~
@1215 = ~Frankly, I think Amn is horrible.~
@1216 = ~Well, I can't say I'm particularly fond of their views on magic.~
@1217 = ~Pretty please?~
@1218 = ~I said no.~
@1219 = ~With a cherry on top?~
@1220 = ~I said *no*!~
@1221 = ~(sigh)~
@1222 = ~Is it then safe to assume this is the sort of place you feel drawn to inhabit?~
@1223 = ~Inhabit? No, there is no such place for me. I will never settle down.~
@1224 = ~I suppose if I ever did put down roots, this wouldn't be so bad.~
@1225 = ~I've never thought about it much. My life doesn't really allow me to stay in one place for long.~
@1226 = ~If you mean permanently, then no, this is not where I'd choose to live.~
@1227 = ~I see. And, all these laws and restrictions, the vigilant gaze of the Cowled ones, these things do not bother you? This sparrow feels eyes upon him everywhere he turns in these lands.~
@1228 = ~Everywhere? Tsk, such silly nonsense you speak at times, my hound. Wander the planes for a few decades, then tell this sparrow you still feel thus.~
@1229 = ~I take it this is not the sort of place you would choose to dwell overlong, then?~
@1230 = ~I don't 'choose to dwell overlong' anywhere. I will never settle in one place.~
@1231 = ~If you mean permanently, then you are correct. This is not where I'd choose to live.~
@1232 = ~Indeed, 'tis most inconvenient to say the least, but these Cowled ones are clever to employ such efficient methods of control.~
@1233 = ~But there is such a place, aye? Somewhere you would put down roots, as they say?~
@1234 = ~Haven't we discussed this before?~
@1235 = ~Yes, I'd like to settle down somewhere.~
@1236 = ~Maybe someday, far in the future.~
@1237 = ~I'll think about it when there's a possibility I will live to see it.~
@1238 = ~I doubt it. I seem destined to be constantly on the move.~
@1239 = ~Never. I have no plans to ever allow myself to become sedate and complacent.~
@1240 = ~'Tis highly probable we have indeed. The surest way to verify the truth of a person's answers is to ask the same question in different ways and compare the answers.~
@1241 = ~We could lose our lives at any moment. What purpose is served by delaying anything when the future may never come?~
@1242 = ~This life of roaming and roving hither and yon agrees with you, does it?~
@1243 = ~Absolutely. I may not have had a choice when I first set out on this path, but I know for certain that I love nothing more than traveling.~
@1244 = ~It's all I've known since I left Candlekeep. I suppose it's hard to tell if it really agrees with me, or if I simply accept it.~
@1245 = ~As much as any other life. I think I would feel just as content if I were instead loading crates at the harbor, or dawdling in my own kitchen.~
@1246 = ~Agrees with me? Hah, you say that as if I have a choice! This is the fate forced upon me. What I want has never mattered, and I doubt it ever will.~
@1247 = ~You seem to find it pleasant enough.~
@1248 = ~Aye, this sparrow well understands the look upon your fair face as you speak of this. Wanderlust, love of the road, passion for the mystery waiting 'round the next bend! There is naught like it in the all the realms, is there <CHARNAME>?~
@1249 = ~Beautifully put, my sparrow. No, there truly is nothing much like it.~
@1250 = ~Indeed, though a fresh ale, a warm hearth and good company come a close second after a long stay on the road.~
@1251 = ~It's a bit like falling in love, perhaps. Ever changing, rarely simple, fraught with danger and uncertainty.~
@1252 = ~Must you spout such silly romantic drivel about everything?~
@1253 = ~You think we are alike, do you?~
@1254 = ~Speaking of the road, we'd better get back to it.~
@1255 = ~A fascinating thought, my raven. Are we a product of the world, or is the world a product of our preconceptions? How can we ever know which of our perceptions is to be believed for that matter? 'Tis something we could surely muse over 'till our dying days.~
@1256 = ~Truly, you are a chameleon after my own heart, my dear raven. I feel much the same in any given setting, though I admit my attention wavers and I soon enough find myself longing for... what is that phrase you use here on the Prime? Greener grasses?~
@1257 = ~This sparrow worries for you, dear one. This bitterness in your heart is a poison, and I fear that you will become a hollow shell of yourself if you cannot find joy somehow.~
@1258 = ~A poet's soul you have, my lovely raven. Indeed love itself is a tumultuous journey, one worth experiencing in all its forms.~
@1259 = ~Ah, just speaking of such things with you sets my heart pounding! What fate awaits us beyond that next rise, dear friend? Adventure? Love? Death, even! 'Tis most inspiring to have found a kindred spirit in you.~
@1260 = ~Love, hmm? Is love something you are pursuing, then?~
@1261 = ~All this talk makes me anxious as well. Back to the road, Haer'Dalis!~
@1262 = ~Wisely put, my friend. 'Tis a refreshment of the soul to find such moments of reprieve, though the less often they come the more heartily we appreciate them, aye?~
@1263 = ~Indeed I must! A poet's tongue cannot deny the longings of his heart. If you cared to look, my hound, I daresay you might find a poet's soul within yourself as well.~
@1264 = ~Birds of a feather we surely are from time to time, my raven. 'Tis not so surprising, all things considered, that we share some common threads.~
@1265 = ~Always, my curious raven. Love is an adventure, a journey of its own, is it not? All things are worth experiencing if you ask this sparrow, and love in all its various forms is no different.~
@1266 = ~Are you a seeker of passion, my raven? Does longing for love fill your thoughts and dreams, or does murder and blood wipe away such longings?~
@1267 = ~I don't share my bed idly, Haer'Dalis. You are not just a convenient warm body to me.~
@1268 = ~Don't assume that sharing a bed with me has some deeper meaning, bard. I'm not looking for love.~
@1269 = ~Someday I will find true love, the kind that lasts a lifetime and overcomes all hardships.~
@1270 = ~I have known love, and I'm sure I will know it again.~
@1271 = ~I am in love right now.~
@1272 = ~There hasn't been a lot of time or opportunity for such things.~
@1273 = ~My body has needs, but my thoughts must stay focused on the path before me. I cannot allow myself to be distracted.~
@1274 = ~Love is a weakness, one that enemies will exploit without a second thought. I do not have weaknesses.~
@1275 = ~Stick around and find out for yourself, my sparrow.~
@1276 = ~I admit, I am pleased to hear you say so. Though the notion of being the plaything of a half-goddess has its own appeal, I assure you.~
@1277 = ~I understand, and I assure you that such an admission has done nothing to lessen my desire for you.~
@1278 = ~Ah, the romantic ideal, overwrought and unrealistic in all ways. Many of the fairer gender delight in such fantasies, but surprised am I to find you amongst them.~
@1279 = ~It seems you and I may be birds of a feather in that regard.~
@1280 = ~Aye? Fascinating. Most fascinating.~
@1281 = ~'Tis true, this bloody and tiresome business of yours is not often conducive to romance. Still, 'tis not an impossible possibility, is it? If nothing else, love is unpredictable.~
@1282 = ~I would like to say that I admire your devotion, but my words would be insincere. An unyielding life would dull this poor sparrow to death.~
@1283 = ~No, of course you haven't a single weakness, my indomitable raven. 'Twas part of your master plan to be captured and tortured by your heartless mage, was it not? Your arrogance, while amusing, does not serve you well.~
@1284 = ~I have no intention of doing otherwise, sweet raven.~
@1285 = ~For my part, this sparrow cannot ever imagine settling here, or any other place for that matter. As with all places, 'tis pleasant enough to visit, but I would not wish to live here. Even my beloved Sigil cannot cage me for long.~
@1286 = ~I'm not surprised you feel that way.~
@1287 = ~You never plan to stop traveling? Not even when you're old and gray?~
@1288 = ~But what if you're injured or crippled and can no longer live like this?~
@1289 = ~What about those you travel with? Must they always be fleeting as well, or could you enjoy the company of someone for all your days?~
@1290 = ~I think we've done enough standing around. Let's get moving.~
@1291 = ~Of course not. You know me well by now, do you not my raven? Perhaps better than any other living creature. Happening upon you was a remarkable thing, truly. At times I wonder...~
@1292 = ~Ah, but listen to this frail sparrow! Babbling on whilst there is battle and glory and discovery waiting for us just over yonder. After you, my dear.~
@1293 = ~Old and gray are two of the very few things I hope to never experience for myself. I find the chance of my survival to such an age to be highly unlikely, if I have anything to say on the matter.~
@1294 = ~If such a sorry fate fell upon this poor sparrow, I would make do somehow. As long as I have use of my tongue, I shall never want for entertainment, aye my raven?~
@1295 = ~I have traveled the planes for decades and as yet have never found such a creature who captured my attention and devotion as you infer. Truly, I do oft wonder if such a person exists, though I do not know if I wish it were so or if I am glad that it seems unlikely. Perhaps both, perhaps neither. 'Tis difficult to say.~
@1296 = ~All business and no banter make my raven a dull girl. As you wish. To the road with us!~
@1297 = ~I've heard it said that the Prime is as diverse as the planes. Do you think there is truth in this?~
@1298 = ~I've never been to the planes, so I'm not sure how I can answer that.~
@1299 = ~Diverse in what ways? Settings? People? Religion and politics?~
@1300 = ~These lands are vast indeed, and full of strange and fantastic places and peoples. There is surely some truth in that saying, yes.~
@1301 = ~This sounds decidedly like the beginning of a philosophical discussion. I don't do philosophical discussions.~
@1302 = ~Are you kidding? If you've seen one country, you've seen them all.~
@1303 = ~Aye, but you have far more experience here than I do. Surely you can provide some insight on its diversity, or lack thereof, no matter how slight that insight may be.~
@1304 = ~These lands are vast indeed, and full of strange and fantastic places and people. There is surely some truth in that saying, yes.~
@1305 = ~Any? All? 'Twas not a trick question, my <CHARNAME>.~
@1306 = ~On the contrary, 'tis a realistic view of your world that I seek.~
@1307 = ~You see, prior to making your delightful acquaintance, I had but little experience with the Prime itself, despite my father being a natural denizen thereof. Nearly all I know of this world I have seen at your side, my raven.~
@1308 = ~But you were at the playhouse with Raelis before we met. Surely you didn't spend all your time behind closed doors.~
@1309 = ~That's a bit sad, when you put it that way.~
@1310 = ~It pleases me to be the wind in your sails on your maiden voyage of these lands, my fair sparrow.~
@1311 = ~There is much to see in these vast lands, many strange and fantastic places and peoples to experience.~
@1312 = ~Honestly, if you've seen one country, you've seen them all.~
@1313 = ~I don't really have an opinion one way or another on this. I haven't had a lot of time to enjoy the scenery, as it were.~
@1314 = ~Not all, but sadly most of this sparrow's time was indeed spent within those walls. Many reasons had we to keep ourselves from prying eyes, our staged personae aside, but hiding has never been something for which I've felt much love. Glad I am to be free of such necessities.~
@1315 = ~That's a bit sad, that all you've known is the world at my side.~
@1316 = ~Sweet raven, I cannot say I wish events had played out any other way.~
@1317 = ~And why is that?~
@1318 = ~There's a lot of excitement in my life, but it's hardly a fond first look into the world of the Prime. Constant travel on dirty roads, bloody battles, ambushes and uncertainty at every turn.~
@1319 = ~I'm not a very good hostess, I suppose. I can't show you the beautiful things of this world, not now at least.~
@1320 = ~It's pathetic the way you've attached yourself to me like some lost dog. I wonder if Raelis felt the same, and if that is why she let you go so easily.~
@1321 = ~Well... I don't know, come to think of it. We travel, which you enjoy, and we fight, which you enjoy, and there's certainly more chaos and entropy than one Doomguard could ask for, isn't there?~
@1322 = ~It's just that there's really not much to see in this realm. If you're expecting more excitement awaits you somewhere else, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.~
@1323 = ~I don't know. It just is.~
@1324 = ~Tsk, my raven at times I wonder if you know me in the slightest. This life you lead is the life I love most, though I must beg you not tell my other lives lest they grow jealous.~
@1325 = ~You show me many beautiful things, fair friend. Each time I look in your eyes, I see beauty, life, passion.~
@1326 = ~Such rehearsed lines you feed me.~
@1327 = ~That's sweet. Thank you.~
@1328 = ~No need to work so hard. You've already seduced me, after all.~
@1329 = ~You're only saying that to stay in my good graces. And my bed.~
@1330 = ~(blush)~
@1331 = ~Covered in blood and muck and gods know what else, and you call me beautiful?~
@1332 = ~Ah, but if I say nothing at all, then I will surely find myself the worse for it.~
@1333 = ~'Tis the truth, and you are most welcome.~
@1334 = ~If you believe I would flatter you unconditionally for that continued honor... then you are very nearly completely correct, sweet raven.~
@1335 = ~You are all the more lovely with tinted cheeks, darling raven.~
@1336 = ~I do. A thousand times, I do.~
@1337 = ~Raelis knew me well. She knew I could not be caged in one place, or to one person for overlong. And she also knew I could not be baited by petty, dishonest insults. 'Tis clear to this sparrow that she knew me far better than you, my hound.~
@1338 = ~You do know me, truly! My raven, you are a wonder to this sparrow at times such as these.~
@1339 = ~Fascinating.~
@1340 = ~Truly? How can you be certain? Have you seen all your world has to offer?~
@1341 = ~I've seen enough.~
@1342 = ~No, not all. But I've heard many things and I don't think other lands have much more to offer.~
@1343 = ~I suppose it's unfair to judge something I've never seen.~
@1344 = ~I just don't think much of the Prime, and with good reason. Nothing good has ever happened to me here, so why should I value it?~
@1345 = ~It brings this sparrow great sadness to hear you say such things, but I also have to wonder if perhaps you find no joy because you do not allow yourself to seek happiness. It is within reach, if you only let yourself see it.~
@1346 = ~At times I wonder if these lands might be worth exploring further, but I cannot be certain if I would be disappointed with what I find beyond your company.~
@1347 = ~Are you saying you wish to leave?~
@1348 = ~Traveling with me has surely ruined you for all other travels, wouldn't you say?~
@1349 = ~I've wondered the same thing. It would be nice to travel for the sake of traveling, instead of this constant running from one errand to the next at the whim of everyone but myself.~
@1350 = ~I think I'd rather see the planes, this Sigil you speak so fondly of, anywhere but here.~
@1351 = ~You'd be disappointed, trust me.~
@1352 = ~That's nice. Can we get moving now?~
@1353 = ~Wherever my path leads, I hope it shall be at the side of one less eager to brush me aside, my hound.~
@1354 = ~Not at this moment, but entropy overcomes all things, even friendship and companionship.~
@1355 = ~Even love?~
@1356 = ~But you'll be here as long as I need you to be, won't you?~
@1357 = ~Good, because I would miss you.~
@1358 = ~Your philosophy is dreadfully depressing, Haer'Dalis.~
@1359 = ~True. Who knows if we'll even live to see tomorrow?~
@1360 = ~Yes, this is all very fascinating, but perhaps we can get going now.~
@1361 = ~Is not friendship a form of love, my raven? Do not fret, I see your meaning well enough. Indeed love is equally as fleeting as everything else, perhaps even more so than most things.~
@1362 = ~You're saying that if I fall in love with you, it won't last?~
@1363 = ~Then why love at all, knowing it will only end in tragedy?~
@1364 = ~That's a very bleak outlook.~
@1365 = ~I suppose looking at it like that, love is all the more precious, isn't it? Because we cannot know how long it will last, we must make the best of every moment we have.~
@1366 = ~It would be difficult to love someone who sees things the way you do.~
@1367 = ~Surely you know what I will say to this, my raven? Nothing lasts, and all things fade away. 'Tis the nature of the multiverse and all within it. We can no more fight against such decay than we can the inevitability of our deaths.~
@1368 = ~Come, then. I did not mean to divert this conversation thus. The road lies ahead. Let us follow it.~
@1369 = ~Tragedy? I fear you and I cannot agree on love if you see tragedy where I see a precious and fragile gift. Enough dallying, aye? Let us be off.~
@1370 = ~To some.~
@1371 = ~I... My raven, forgive me. At times I look upon you and I wonder if you are perfection itself. Your humble bard is near speechless.~
@1372 = ~Please, let us return to the road, that I might find my tongue somewhere along the way.~
@1373 = ~So I've been told.~
@1374 = ~As long as I am able, of that you can be sure.~
@1375 = ~'Tis a strange thing to this Doomguard, but I find myself warmed by your sentiment. Thank you, my <CHARNAME>.~
@1376 = ~Only when viewed from one side, my raven. Do not fear, for you are not the first to misunderstand the Doomguard way, nor shall you be the last.~
@1377 = ~Rather confident of that, aren't you my bold hound? I will say with fond certainty that this journey would not be the same without your presence to light the darkness.~
@1378 = ~A woman after my own heart is what you are, my dear friend. Mayhap fate will allow us to enjoy such journeys together.~
@1379 = ~I'd like that.~
@1380 = ~If we survive.~
@1381 = ~I'm not sure I want that. Nothing personal, but the idea of traveling by myself for a while has a lot of appeal.~
@1382 = ~I doubt that.~
@1383 = ~Not interested. You're useful now, but I don't see that usefulness lasting long.~
@1384 = ~Indeed.~
@1385 = ~I cannot fault you for that, for I myself have felt much the same more than once in my years. Truly at times I am awed at how alike we are, my raven.~
@1386 = ~'Twould be a delight to show them to you.~
@1387 = ~I put little thought to the future, as my life may find its end at any moment, but I do at times idly wonder at what is to come. Will we live to see your quest come to its end? What awaits you after all is ended? Will you still want for this sparrow's company?~
@1388 = ~Ah, but 'tis no good to stand about wondering, aye? Never will we see if the future waits for us if we stand about all day. Onward, raven!~
@1389 = ~Little heed do I pay to good fortune, but I think 'twas fine luck on my part to have stumbled across you, my fair raven.~
@1390 = ~Wasn't it I who stumbled across you?~
@1391 = ~I'm glad we met, too.~
@1392 = ~Would you say the same if we weren't intimate, I wonder.~
@1393 = ~I don't believe in luck.~
@1394 = ~Fine luck for you, perhaps. I'm forced to listen to your constant prattle and inane flatteries for countless hours on end.~
@1395 = ~What brought this on?~
@1396 = ~Aye, I suppose it was. Though had I not accompanied Miss Raelis on her venture to the Prime, I would surely have never found myself at the mercy of that sewer mage.~
@1397 = ~In that case, I'm rather glad you got caught stealing.~
@1398 = ~It *is* a rather odd string of coincidences that brought us together.~
@1399 = ~I don't think our meeting had anything to do with luck.~
@1400 = ~Do you regret following her?~
@1401 = ~You were a fool to let yourself be captured, and Raelis was a fool to insist upon your rescue.~
@1402 = ~Ah, how my pride recoils to hear you phrase it thus, my cruel raven! Alas that I underestimated my quarry that day. Yet, in some twist of irony, I too find myself glad for my misstep.~
@1403 = ~I have often thought the same, and not only of *our* meeting. How many times have I marveled at the unimaginable oddities of life's course? More than I can count, it seems.~
@1404 = ~Oh, not for a moment, my raven! Though, in all honesty, regret is not a bedfellow with whom I often wake. There is so very much to experience in one lifetime, and even foolish or terrible choices are experiences as well. To regret them is to regret life, I would think.~
@1405 = ~Ah, but you misjudge my former leader. 'Twas only in part that she sent you to seek her lost bird, and not an equal part at that. Survival was her concern, my hound, and she wished only for the gem.~
@1406 = ~I warms me to hear you say so. Much darkness have you seen in your life, and I wish to be... well, if not a light, I would at least be less than black for you.~
@1407 = ~You are, and for that you will always have my gratitude.~
@1408 = ~Darkness seems to be something you have experienced in abundance as well.~
@1409 = ~I don't need your 'light' or your pity. I will survive and *succeed* with or without your assistance, bard.~
@1410 = ~Ah-ha! Do you see how you make this sparrow blush? Your wiles are not wasted on me, dear one.~
@1411 = ~You are most astute, my wise raven. 'Tis a burden at times, yet I cannot help but wonder if we would be the same creatures we are now had we not suffered. We are both the stronger for it all, my <CHARNAME>.~
@1412 = ~Pity is not something I am prone to feeling for any creature, let alone a woman of your strength. Your tough talk may work on others, but I am less inclined to take you at face value, my dear hound.~
@1413 = ~I believe I would indeed. My interest in you lies not solely between your lovely thighs, my sweet raven. Surely you have realized this.~
@1414 = ~But my thighs interest you nonetheless.~
@1415 = ~The feeling is mutual, my sweet sparrow.~
@1416 = ~My interest in you, however, begins and ends in the bedsheets. Do not mistake familiarity with fondness, Haer'Dalis.~
@1417 = ~But of course! And... now you have distracted me. What was I...? Oh... ah, yes, as I was saying...~
@1418 = ~Understood.~
@1419 = ~If you desire silence, all you need do is ask. Until you ask, this sparrow shall continue to sing.~
@1420 = ~No? Then you believe in fate, I take it?~
@1421 = ~Of course. How else can you explain my life? By all rights, I should be dead many times over.~
@1422 = ~I believe in the gods, and the path they set before me.~
@1423 = ~I'm not sure what I believe, but I don't like the idea of my tomorrow being some random unknown.~
@1424 = ~Those are my only choices? Fortune or fate?~
@1425 = ~My beliefs are none of your business.~
@1426 = ~Ah. I cannot say I fathom such devotion as yours, especially when one considers your trials and tribulations thus far. But I shall not judge you for your comforts.~
@1427 = ~I have yet to hear any option that cannot be placed under either banner.~
@1428 = ~On the contrary, you are forced to do nothing of the sort, my hound. If my presence is not desired, you've but to say the word and off I shall fly to greater ventures.~
@1429 = ~Oh, I spoke only in jest! Forgive me if I seemed sincere. On my word, I don't want you anywhere but with me, Haer'Dalis.~
@1430 = ~I know.~
@1431 = ~I'll keep that in mind for the next moment like this when you make me crazy with your babbling!~
@1432 = ~Thoughts and idle fancies flock to this bard's mind in fleeting droves, but 'tis not often that a single refrain repeats and circles itself. And yet here you are, oft in my musings in all your glory. Alas, I cannot shake you loose.~
@1433 = ~Would you believe I'm having the same problem with thoughts of you?~
@1434 = ~Ugh, save your overblown platitudes for some wilting flower.~
@1435 = ~Ah, indeed. Perhaps you understand me, then, when I tell you that hearing such things from you both worries and excites this sparrow in strange and unfamiliar ways. But that is talk for another time.~
@1436 = ~Destiny is a curious concept for this bard. You see, while I know an inevitable destiny awaits us at the end of our life, I wonder on all this time between birth and death, during which I see little proof of pattern or meaning such as destiny should bring.~
@1437 = ~'Inevitable destiny' meaning death? Is that all you think about?~
@1438 = ~It sounds like you're saying we're all destined to die but not destined to live.~
@1439 = ~Just because you don't see the pattern doesn't mean it isn't there.~
@1440 = ~I'm not sure destiny is something that can be proven. Who, exactly, would we call upon to bear witness to someone's destiny?~
@1441 = ~That's where the intervention of the gods comes into play. They see where a need is and use someone to fill the necessary role.~
@1442 = ~It's all just random. No use getting a headache thinking about it too long.~
@1443 = ~Some people don't find that 'inevitable destiny' of yours. They go on to become gods.~
@1444 = ~That's nice. Are we done chatting now?~
@1445 = ~Certainly not! My thoughts range far and wide, hither and yon. 'Twould be foolish and ultimately pointless to ignore death, though. It is the only form of destiny that this sparrow knows.~
@1446 = ~That is not the message I intended, but the statement is very true, even in such simple terms. We have no guarantee of life beyond this very moment, but death... death we cannot escape even should we wish it. Is that not the very definition of destiny?~
@1447 = ~It sounds so hopeless when you put it that way.~
@1448 = ~That makes sense, I suppose.~
@1449 = ~Eh, I'm not really sure what I believe.~
@1450 = ~I don't agree with that at all. Every life has meaning, every person has a place.~
@1451 = ~Ah, but only if you focus upon the aspect of death on its own. My raven, without death, there could be no new life. If nothing ever faded and passed into memory, there would be no need for renewal. Life would stagnate into a state far worse than death. Draw comfort in that renewal.~
@1452 = ~Those are rather bold statements to make, my friend. Tell me, what purpose was the life of a child stillborn? Or that of a man born in the gutter who spends the entirety of his life begging for coin only to die of some wasting illness in that very same pit?~
@1453 = ~Your own philosophy answers that readily. Death gives way to new life and renewal, but death cannot come without life. That means that the lives of those people were just as meaningful as their deaths. They were equally as destined for life as they were for death.~
@1454 = ~Those are terrible examples!~
@1455 = ~I never said I had all the answers, or that I could explain or even understand specific cases like those. It's just something I *know*, Haer'Dalis.~
@1456 = ~Well, they... That is to say the... Hmm...~
@1457 = ~I'm bored with this conversation. Are we done chatting now?~
@1458 = ~I... My raven, I am... Such twists of logic you are capable of! Hah! 'Tis delightful to admit that I stand corrected, though you've really accomplished little more than a play on words. Intriguing nonetheless, I assure you.~
@1459 = ~And life is full of such examples! 'Tis no fault of this sparrow that suffering and sorrow abound.~
@1460 = ~I cannot fault you for your convictions, my dear raven, for I understand well this look you give me now.~
@1461 = ~And who, pray tell, shall we call upon as a witness of these patterns then? Forgive me, but I cannot readily place trust in that which has no reason behind it.~
@1462 = ~Mayhap you see this as a comfort, but when this sparrow hears of a greater power *using* a lesser power for needs that this supposed 'authority' deems necessary, my thoughts are anything but calmed.~
@1463 = ~You, above all creatures, should see the folly of such words. Even gods die, <CHARNAME>.~
@1464 = ~I have heard your name strung together with 'fate' and 'prophecy' and 'destiny' many times, my raven. Do you pay heed to such talk?~
@1465 = ~I believe it very much, yes. I have a great destiny unfolding.~
@1466 = ~Sometimes I do, but other times... I don't know, what if I'm just some lucky fool who might as well have died yesterday for all her importance in the grand design of life?~
@1467 = ~Not really.~
@1468 = ~I try to just live my life and block those things out, but it can be difficult.~
@1469 = ~No, not in the least. That kind of talk is nothing but a distraction.~
@1470 = ~The only words I care about are 'power' and 'more power.' Destiny, prophecy - I don't give a damn about any of it either way as long as nothing stands in the way of my rise to power.~
@1471 = ~This will seem strange, but at moments like this, I feel I am looking not at *you*, my <CHARNAME>, but at some powerful, distant creature beyond my comprehension. Truly, you are inspiring in ways I do not think you comprehend.~
@1472 = ~If that is fear that trembles in your voice, it is only because you cling to doubt. When you stop clutching at life with two hands like a drowning man on a bit of driftwood, and instead allow the currents to carry you, those thoughts melt away. *You* are the cause of your own fear.~
@1473 = ~Ah, but listen to this sparrow babbling! I shall only add that it is a curious thought, this idea that meeting you was meant to be and not simply chance.~
@1474 = ~Now, come! The road awaits.~
@1475 = ~I thank you for your honesty, my raven. 'Twas most enlightening.~
@1476 = ~That I can understand well, and I admire your discipline.~
@1477 = ~And when that power fades, as all things do, what then? Nay, do not answer! I tease my raven, but I have no great longing for a tongue lashing from you at present.~
@1478 = ~Come, let us return to your task.~
@1479 = ~Truly, my raven, you are an artist unrivaled. Such a delight it is to stand in your presence!~
@1480 = ~It's a pleasure to be appreciated by one who knows our craft as well as you do.~
@1481 = ~My skills are far superior to your own, little actor. Perhaps you shall learn a thing or two in my company.~
@1482 = ~I'm a warrior, not an artist.~
@1483 = ~Hah, you think I'm a poet on the battlefield, do you?~
@1484 = ~I have talented hands and many skills, but I've never seen what I do as particularly artistic.~
@1485 = ~Admiring my graceful moves and deft fingers, are you?~
@1486 = ~You see something artistic in the way I throw spells?~
@1487 = ~I do as my god bids, nothing more, nothing less.~
@1488 = ~Thank you. It's nice to be appreciated for my skills.~
@1489 = ~Flattery? What's this about?~
@1490 = ~It's true that killing is an artform.~
@1491 = ~But how could I not appreciate your talents? Your skills are a marvel to behold, both on the battlefield and off. This sparrow has worked with many talented creatures throughout the years, but I am unable to conjure to mind a single one to match your skill.~
@1492 = ~Flattery will get you everywhere, you know.~
@1493 = ~Thank you. I'm glad you think so.~
@1494 = ~I'm not so sure about all that.~
@1495 = ~You're exaggerating.~
@1496 = ~You must want something from me to lavish such worthless praise upon me. Out with it.~
@1497 = ~Mayhap you'd gift this sparrow with a lesson in humility, aye?~
@1498 = ~You are both. Your battle-cry is your song, your movements upon the battlefield are your dance, and the spray of blood that hangs in the air is pure poetry!~
@1499 = ~I have no desire to be linked to art in any form!~
@1500 = ~I do indeed! Your battle-cry is your song, your movements upon the battlefield are your dance, and the spray of blood that hangs in the air is beauty itself!~
@1501 = ~Let me assure you that the way you move is nothing short of awe inspiring. 'Tis like watching an accomplished dancer at work, only my raven steals far more than the spotlight. She could just as easily take a man's purse or his life at her whim.~
@1502 = ~Among other things, as often and long as possible.~
@1503 = ~Most assuredly. You are a sculptor of reality, melding and shaping the air, the ground, even the minds of our enemies! A portrait of struggle and mortality is what you paint, and the world and all her denizens are your canvas.~
@1504 = ~'Tis a dull way to describe yourself, <CHARNAME>, and I fail to see how your allegiance to your god prohibits you from accepting due praise.~
@1505 = ~Aye? This I shall have to keep in mind, my sweet raven.~
@1506 = ~Aye, this I know very well, my dear one.~
@1507 = ~You are most welcome, my raven. 'Tis nothing but the truth, I assure you.~
@1508 = ~My raven, you wound me terribly to imply that I would exaggerate what I see to be true! Nothing but the truth shall fly from this sparrow's lips!~
@1509 = ~Tsk, you would truly accuse your humblest sparrow of such base manipulations of flattery and deceit? I am hurt, my raven, that you would even think me capable of such illusions.~
@1510 = ~And that means you are a most talented and fearful artist.~
@1511 = ~Why ever not?~
@1512 = ~Because I'm a realist, not some flighty fool with her head in the clouds!~
@1513 = ~Art is *boring*.~
@1514 = ~I will not glorify the things I do with some poetic illusion. I am a *killer*.~
@1515 = ~I... Well, I just won't have it is all!~
@1516 = ~By the gods, will you just get to the point?~
@1517 = ~'Tis a common misconception that all artists must be star-eyed dreamers, my raven, and I assure it is far from true. I see far more creative spirit and passionate imagination in you than you realize.~
@1518 = ~I... My cruel, cruel hound, I insist that we wipe this lapse of yours from our collective memories and move on as if you had not spoken at all. Boring indeed!~
@1519 = ~We cannot always find joy in what we *do*, my raven, but there is always a way to find contentment in what we *are*. Do not be so quick to martyr your happiness, my dear friend, for the alternative is likely not what you expect.~
@1520 = ~Long have I watched you and fought at your side, and regardless of the direction of your efforts, excellence is what you achieve. 'Tis astounding, my dear raven, that everyone you meet does not marvel at the wondrous being you most assuredly are.~
@1521 = ~I do not say this as idle flattery, and casting all jests aside, I am awed by you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1522 = ~I work very hard to earn what I know. This life is not easy.~
@1523 = ~I've sacrificed much to come this far.~
@1524 = ~Things come so effortlessly to me.~
@1525 = ~It's my blood that does these things. There'd be nothing special about me if Bhaal's taint were removed.~
@1526 = ~I agree completely. Everyone should bow at my feet and pay me tribute. Someday they will, whether they want to or not.~
@1527 = ~Okay, flatterer, what do you *really* want?~
@1528 = ~Aye, it certainly is not, even for the average berk. The trials that shadow your path seem like twisted nightmares compared the petty troubles of the common man, yet your determination leads you to triumph over each obstacle.~
@1529 = ~So I understand, my dear raven. While you most certainly have my sympathies for all you've lost, I cannot help but marvel at all you now have. Strife has brought you strength.~
@1530 = ~I have noticed this. Perhaps I am wrong, but at times it seems to this sparrow that you surprise even yourself with what you are capable of and the power that waits just below the surface inside you.~
@1531 = ~Ah, my raven, what would you be without your blood? And more importantly, what would your blood be without you? Without your blood, you would be dead, and without you, your blood would... be a rather morbid splotch upon the ground, I imagine.~
@1532 = ~I do not mean to make light of your somber declaration, but 'tis foolish to separate the two in your mind. To reject one is to reject the other, and in doing so, you doom yourself. You are who you are.~
@1533 = ~This sparrow very much wonders if he will live to see that day. I surely hope so.~
@1534 = ~(sigh) Can a man not make an honest observation of his lovely companion without drawing suspicion? Perhaps it is the norm in the average males you've known to charm through flattery with ulterior motives, but I assure you, I am anything but average.~
@1535 = ~I did not intend to delay us with a long and winding speech, my raven. 'Twas only that I wonder at times if you realize your own worth, the value of the powerful creature and beautiful muse that you most assuredly are. Let no one and nothing tell you otherwise.~
@1536 = ~Thank you, Haer'Dalis.~
@1537 = ~That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me.~
@1538 = ~Value, is it? How valuable am I to you, I wonder.~
@1539 = ~I'm not sure of that, but I'm glad you believe it.~
@1540 = ~As soon as I relax, you're going to ask me for new armor or a different watch duty or something, aren't you?~
@1541 = ~I'm well aware of all of that.~
@1542 = ~Yes, well, now that I'm thoroughly embarrassed, let's get moving, shall we?~
@1543 = ~'Tis my pleasure, dear raven.~
@1544 = ~And that, my dear, is a pity and a shame. I shall have to slather you with praise as often as I'm able to make up for all the compliments you should have gotten over the years.~
@1545 = ~You are stunning, my radiant raven.~
@1546 = ~More than I think you realize. Much more.~
@1547 = ~Then I shall simply have to repeat myself over and over until you either believe or send me from your sight.~
@1548 = ~Hah! If you've a mind for giving, I am always in the mood to receive favors, but I came to speak of these things with no need of returned sentiments in any form. 'Twas simply important to me that you hear the words spoken aloud.~
@1549 = ~I am glad to have spoken nonetheless.~
@1550 = ~But you look so lovely when you blush and fidget! Very well, onward we go.~
@1551 = ~Apologies if I seem thoughtful, raven. 'Twas not but a few days past when I spotted a pair of lovers bidding each other farewell for the final time. The sorrow on the young man's face has been in my mind ever since.~
@1552 = ~Don't you believe that entropy is the normal way of things? Why would you feel sad over something you claim should be celebrated?~
@1553 = ~That sounds terribly sad.~
@1554 = ~I think I saw them, too. The woman looked so upset!~
@1555 = ~I wonder what tore them apart.~
@1556 = ~Losing love is never easy.~
@1557 = ~He probably brought it on himself. Males are idiots, especially when it comes to females.~
@1558 = ~What makes you think I care one whit about this idiotic nonsense?~
@1559 = ~It is normal, and I do celebrate it, but that does not mean I am immune to the same pains as any other mortal. Loss and tragedy - the devastation of these things is not lost upon this sparrow, but perhaps the difference is that I accept their place in life instead of resenting them.~
@1560 = ~Well, your story sounds terribly sad.~
@1561 = ~I think I saw those lovers, too. The woman looked so upset!~
@1562 = ~I wonder what tore those two apart.~
@1563 = ~Well, he probably brought it on himself. Males are idiots, especially when it comes to females.~
@1564 = ~'Twas sad indeed. The youthful spirit in their eyes was dulled with shades of regret, and backs bent under the weight of their broken hearts. Alas, the only cure for such ills is time and time alone.~
@1565 = ~That's true. Time heals all wounds.~
@1566 = ~I hope they find love again.~
@1567 = ~People should be more careful about giving their hearts away.~
@1568 = ~Eh, just let them drink themselves into oblivion and toss them a decent whore. A cure for all ailments!~
@1569 = ~So it is said.~
@1570 = ~As do I. Life slips away in the blink of an eye, and 'twould be a shame for anyone to waste it all on longing for the past.~
@1571 = ~Perhaps. Guard it too closely, however, and many wondrous and delightful experiences may pass by. 'Tis a question of whether joy is worth the pain it may bring, and to that this sparrow declares a resounding, 'Aye!'~
@1572 = ~Hah, that certainly works for some! 'Tis merely a weak salve upon the hurt for most people, though, and not enough to close the wound. If bitterness breeds in the heart, these things can turn a decent soul into a cruel and wretched shell. This sparrow has seen it all too often.~
@1573 = ~For good reason, I imagine. Parting may be sweet sorrow, but parting for all time is far more of the latter and little of the former in this sparrow's estimation.~
@1574 = ~True. Still, time heals all wounds.~
@1575 = ~Eh, just let them drink themselves into oblivion and toss them a decent whore. A cure for all ills!~
@1576 = ~We are birds of a feather in this then, for I wondered that very same thing. Perhaps he found her with another man, or his heart was torn between two loves. Mayhap it was simply not meant to be.~
@1577 = ~I don't believe that's a good enough excuse for anything. There's always a way to make things work if someone really wants it bad enough.~
@1578 = ~It's possible. Whatever the case, time heals all wounds.~
@1579 = ~Ah, but matters of the heart require *two* people with equal passion and desire for a happy ending. 'Tis difficult enough to convince two people to agree on mundane issues, never mind anything bloated on oft exaggerated emotions.~
@1580 = ~But I suppose you have far more experience with improbable situations than I, my raven, so perhaps you are wiser than I in this.~
@1581 = ~Tsk, such a bitter accusation, but one with some merit. Many men struggle all their days to understand the fairer sex and never learn anything, and many women are far too stubborn to give up their secrets and let themselves be understood. 'Tis something both could improve upon.~
@1582 = ~Do you wish me to be silent, my hound?~
@1583 = ~No, forgive me. I'm not feeling myself today.~
@1584 = ~I'm just not in the mood for this right now.~
@1585 = ~I've been trying to find the switch that shuts you off for weeks now.~
@1586 = ~Hells yes!~
@1587 = ~What ails you, <CHARNAME>?~
@1588 = ~There's a lot of pressure. It's a difficult burden to bear.~
@1589 = ~I'm tired mostly. My dreams have been... distressing.~
@1590 = ~Nothing specific. Perhaps it's just the stress of travel and responsibility.~
@1591 = ~Don't worry. I'll be fine.~
@1592 = ~None of your business.~
@1593 = ~Nothing, I was just trying to be polite. Is there some nice way I can tell you to shut your flapping lips?~
@1594 = ~Would that I could help you bear up under its weight, my dear raven, but it seems the bulk can only be carried by you. Therefore, I shall do whatever I can to be your support. You've but to ask, and I am yours to command.~
@1595 = ~Within reason, of course.~
@1596 = ~Ah, this look in your eyes, it is one I know well. I shall not press you on the content of your nightly distress, but if ever I can help in any way, I am here, my dear one.~
@1597 = ~Aye, such things can be trying, 'tis true. And you've not been long at this life, so it's a wonder indeed that you do as well as you do.~
@1598 = ~Fine? Tsk, 'twould be better to be dead than 'fine!' 'Tis a sickening word to this sparrow. I insist that you must be nothing less than deliriously ecstatic over life and all it holds for you! Till then, I shall not cease my worry for you, my raven.~
@1599 = ~Mayhap I should try a different approach?~
@1600 = ~Oh-ho! Well, I shall have you know that wiser heads than yours have searched in vain for just such a device since the day of my birth! Little luck you shall have, I fear, in succeeding where they have failed, my witty raven.~
@1601 = ~I'm not giving up that easily.~
@1602 = ~Heh, you're so silly.~
@1603 = ~That was my polite way of saying 'shut your flapping lips before I shut them for you.'~
@1604 = ~Oh, would you just shut your mouth!~
@1605 = ~I could not imagine that you would.~
@1606 = ~'Twas you who started it, my sweet one!~
@1607 = ~That does not sound like a polite thing to say in any form, my hound. But I shall bear you no grudge for it.~
@1608 = ~Nay, I fear I cannot comply.~
@1609 = ~You speak as one with some experience on this subject.~
@1610 = ~More than I'm willing to admit, actually.~
@1611 = ~(lie) Uh, yeah! Of course. Lots of experience.~
@1612 = ~I've known love once, yes.~
@1613 = ~(lie) Sure, I've had my heart broken.~
@1614 = ~I've had lovers, but I'm not sure if I ever really loved them, if you know what I mean.~
@1615 = ~I'm in love right now.~
@1616 = ~No, I have no experience with romance.~
@1617 = ~(lie) What? *Me*? No, no, I'm pure as freshly fallen snow!~
@1618 = ~I don't really want to discuss it.~
@1619 = ~What of you, my mysterious raven? Have you known the harsh and soothing thrill of love's embrace, or is your heart yet untouched by such madness?~
@1620 = ~I have quite a bit of experience with love, actually.~
@1621 = ~(lie) Uh, yeah! Of course I've had lots of lovers!~
@1622 = ~Then this we have in common. Have you fond memories of your trysts, or does bile rise to the back of your throat at the very thought of their names?~
@1623 = ~I choose only those worthy of my time, and I have fond memories of my past loves.~
@1624 = ~I suppose a bit of both.~
@1625 = ~Oh, they definitely make me gag. Worthless filth, the lot of them!~
@1626 = ~Names? Why would I need their names?~
@1627 = ~That's a bit personal.~
@1628 = ~Only those worthy of you, aye? And how, I wonder, does this sparrow rate on that scale of worth?~
@1629 = ~Considering I let you into my bed, I would have thought the answer was obvious.~
@1630 = ~I think I'll keep that information to myself.~
@1631 = ~If you have to ask...~
@1632 = ~Higher than I think you realize.~
@1633 = ~Obvious answers are no less worthy of affirmation.~
@1634 = ~I share your bed, my raven. I think 'twould be a simple thing to extract this information I seek from you in any number of ways.~
@1635 = ~Is that a challenge I sense in your tone? I shall take it as one either way.~
@1636 = ~Ah, my sweet raven, such a pleasant answer you give. 'Tis a sincere smile you've brought to this bard's face.~
@1637 = ~Bah, I shall simply have to use my talents to seek this precious information some other way!~
@1638 = ~Tsk, such a cruel tease you are, my raven.~
@1639 = ~Aye, 'tis the common course of things to mingle the good with the bad in nearly equal measure. Glad I am that not all your experiences were terrible.~
@1640 = ~This sparrow is obligated to point out that the only common link in this chain of terrible lovers is you.~
@1641 = ~Ah, I see how you work. I once knew an erinyes just like you, my raven. A pity she did not pay mind to the names of her consorts, or perhaps she would have realized one of them was the husband of her insanely jealous employer. A waste of a perfectly lovely young creature, if you ask this sparrow.~
@1642 = ~I suppose it is at that. My apologies if I have pried too deeply into your affairs.~
@1643 = ~Indeed? Mayhap you will regale your humble sparrow with a tale or two of your exploits, hmm?~
@1644 = ~I suppose there's no harm in that. Would you like to hear about the time I was caught by Gorion in the hayloft? Oh, I'd never seen his face turn that color before! Or perhaps the time I fell into a river and was rescued by those dashing pirates... oh, I can never recall their names...~
@1645 = ~Uh... sure. Well, what I mean to say is...~
@1646 = ~Pfft, a lady never tells!~
@1647 = ~Um... oh, fine! I may have lied. Just a little bit.~
@1648 = ~These questions are really personal.~
@1649 = ~Hah! My dear, dear raven, if only you'd give yourself over to the Art! Truly, you would make a fine bard with such performances!~
@1650 = ~Hah! Truly you are an actress worthy of my company, dear raven! 'Tis a delight to watch you work.~
@1651 = ~Really, there is not need for deception. I do not ask you these things with some sinister motive, but simply because I wish to understand you better. Surely that cannot be such a terrible thing, aye?~
@1652 = ~And apparently a Child of Bhaal is not only a liar, but an unrepentant one at that.~
@1653 = ~Ah, one tragic long lost love, perhaps?~
@1654 = ~Yes, I suppose that does describe it adequately.~
@1655 = ~Not lost! Someday we'll be together again. It just couldn't work out at the time.~
@1656 = ~Oh it was definitely tragic. Tragic that I wasted my time on that fool!~
@1657 = ~I was lonely and scared and very unappreciative. I didn't know how much I needed that companionship until it was too late.~
@1658 = ~Eh, you win some, you lose some, right? Life goes on.~
@1659 = ~My apologies if I have brought sorrowful memories to mind, my dear raven. 'Twas only my intention to know you better that brought about these questions, and I meant no ill by them.~
@1660 = ~Does the word 'delusional' offend you? Hmm, best not risk it, aye?~
@1661 = ~I'm sure the rift between you was no fault of your own in the least, my raven.~
@1662 = ~Indeed, though such a cavalier attitude seems contrived. But who am I to question your sincerity?~
@1663 = ~Oh? And what was this true love's name, my dear?~
@1664 = ~I will not name names, but I can tell you how we met. Oh, Haer'Dalis, it was so romantic! We-~
@1665 = ~Uh... the name was... well, what I mean to say is...~
@1666 = ~Aye, I do indeed understand your meaning well. Tell me, do you believe your true love waits for you, somewhere beyond the horizon?~
@1667 = ~I'm sure there is someone perfect for me somewhere, yes.~
@1668 = ~I'm not certain. Perhaps it's fate, perhaps it's luck... perhaps I'm not meant to find love at all.~
@1669 = ~No, I'm not really fond of that romantic drivel.~
@1670 = ~I've never thought about it.~
@1671 = ~Ah, so you are a dreamer and a romantic both? How curious.~
@1672 = ~'Tis a dire proclamation you make in this sparrow's eyes. To never know love... My raven, I can think of many wondrous experiences I would gladly give up if it meant I could still know the feeling of love in my heart. Do not toss it aside if your chance comes.~
@1673 = ~Surely it is not all bad, my raven.~
@1674 = ~Perhaps you should.~
@1675 = ~Oh, how exciting! Hmm, I cannot decide if I wish to beg the name from your lips, or live with the suspense of wondering...~
@1676 = ~No, do not answer! I shall watch and figure it out for myself.~
@1677 = ~Truly? 'Tis tragedy you speak! Surely you've had opportunities at your disposal. Why have you yet kept yourself from such dalliances?~
@1678 = ~I'm waiting for the right person, I suppose. The perfect person.~
@1679 = ~I'm not certain I'm ever meant to find love at all.~
@1680 = ~I've just never been able to make time for such things.~
@1681 = ~I'm not particularly interested in romance.~
@1682 = ~Methinks the lady doth protest too much.~
@1683 = ~Nonsense! I even considered a vow of chastity, but who knows what my future may bring? I don't want to be trapped by regrets.~
@1684 = ~Pfft, and a lady never tells!~
@1685 = ~It's too painful.~
@1686 = ~It makes me sad and moody.~
@1687 = ~It's boring.~
@1688 = ~Let the past stay in the past.~
@1689 = ~Because I care about you.~
@1690 = ~This conversation is over. Start walking.~
@1691 = ~Wounds left to fester never shall heal, my gentle raven. I will leave you to your thoughts, but know that I am here with you now. Beckon if you have need of me.~
@1692 = ~Well, we would not want that! Eh, the sad bit, of course.~
@1693 = ~This sparrow finds even the dullest minutia of your life to be enthralling. Never doubt that I shall wish to hear your tales, my raven.~
@1694 = ~Using my own words against me, are you? Cruel raven.~
@1695 = ~And I adore you in return, my raven, but this sparrow cannot fathom why that would exclude the free exchange of tales between us. I assure you, I have no motives other than a deep wish to know you better than I do now. I am here if you have need of me.~
@1696 = ~As you desire.~
@1697 = ~Come, let us walk together till battle calls us next.~
@1698 = ~My, but look how I have rambled on like a gossiping old crone! Forgive me, but I find this topic most informative. You have my thanks for letting me bend your ear for a spell.~
@1699 = ~You frighten me at times, my raven.~
@1700 = ~I'm sorry.~
@1701 = ~I would never hurt you.~
@1702 = ~Don't be silly.~
@1703 = ~Are you always so quick to spew an apology when one is not sought? Foolishness does not wear you well.~
@1704 = ~An absurd declaration. We *all* hurt one another. 'Tis part of our nature, part of the ebb and flow of life's tides.~
@1705 = ~Surely I am not the first to comment upon your frightful nature.~
@1706 = ~As a matter of fact, you are the first.~
@1707 = ~Maybe not, but I'm curious what brought this on.~
@1708 = ~No, of course not.~
@1709 = ~Stop being evasive and tell me what you're talking about.~
@1710 = ~Is there a point to this?~
@1711 = ~Odd. 'Tis not in the nature of this sparrow to be easily cowed, so surely I am not the first to feel this... this... gnawing, constant... *discomfort* in your presence. 'Twould seem I am only the first bold enough to make mention of it.~
@1712 = ~Aye, any progeny of your parentage is feared by many for no other reason than the taint in your veins. This is not what I find worrisome when I look upon you, though mayhap it is all related.~
@1713 = ~'Tis not an easy thing this sparrow confesses, my impatient hound. In truth, I know not why I speak of it at all. Perhaps 'tis merely curiosity that drives me, and a mad wondering at how you will respond.~
@1714 = ~Is there ever?~
@1715 = ~I have told you before that you are a harbinger of entropy and chaos, and our time spent together has done nothing but prove this true time and again.~
@1716 = ~What I have only recently come to realize is that this decay does not touch *you*. It clings to you, moves through you, taints everything near you with its relentless hunger, but it is not part of you.~
@1717 = ~I don't understand.~
@1718 = ~And that frightens you.~
@1719 = ~You sound angry.~
@1720 = ~What are you talking about? Terrible things happen to me all the time!~
@1721 = ~Yes, I've noticed that as well.~
@1722 = ~Of course not. It would be hard to achieve my destiny if I was a weak, pathetic mortal.~
@1723 = ~Angry? I... No, I do not believe anger is the proper word, though frankly what that word might be eludes me at present.~
@1724 = ~Perhaps it is not easy for you to see it yourself. Often, when we are too close to something or someone, perspective is difficult to find.~
@1725 = ~Nothing weighs you down. Nothing stops you from attaining that which you put your mind to. Everything that should take a piece of you, break you as time and decay break all things, instead gives you strength. You create power from nothing, from *less than* nothing!~
@1726 = ~Of course not. It would be hard to achieve godhood if I was as weak as a pathetic mortal.~
@1727 = ~Aye, it does.~
@1728 = ~But that is exactly the point! Horrific, world-altering, *tragic* events shadow your every move! Were you any other person, any other creature, you would have long ago been crushed beneath the weight of your life, my raven!~
@1729 = ~Does none of this worry you?~
@1730 = ~It terrifies me!~
@1731 = ~Someday it will all catch up to me.~
@1732 = ~Should it?~
@1733 = ~It's exciting.~
@1734 = ~Hah, I love it! It's like a taste of immortality.~
@1735 = ~As well it should. You are... unnatural. I know not how to see you, my raven. You do not fit with anything I know to be true. I fear what you will become as we move forward, and I am not certain how to face such fear.~
@1736 = ~You're not making me feel any better, Haer'Dalis.~
@1737 = ~I think we're both making too much of this.~
@1738 = ~Do you want to leave?~
@1739 = ~Do you think I'm a monster?~
@1740 = ~Please don't say such things. I need you at my side.~
@1741 = ~Hah, likely you just fear that I'll have no use of you someday soon and cast you aside.~
@1742 = ~I believe so as well. The question is, what will that mean? What will become of you?~
@1743 = ~We'll find out one way or another.~
@1744 = ~As long as you're with me, everything will be fine.~
@1745 = ~I don't fear what I will become. I welcome it!~
@1746 = ~Truly, I know not. 'Tis likely something you cannot change either way, short of ending your life prematurely, but in many ways that only makes me fear you more. Everything unnatural comes so naturally to you...~
@1747 = ~I think you're making too much of this.~
@1748 = ~It's just a sign of my greatness, of the power I will one day wield!~
@1749 = ~I cannot deny the truth of that. Fear is thrilling in its own way, and it is something I have spent decades learning to accept and enjoy. But this fear... this I cannot seem to shake. I look into your eyes, and it comes forth anew.~
@1750 = ~But you are not immortal! And even if you were, that would not exclude you from the inevitable decay of all things!~
@1751 = ~Would you rather me mope and wring my hands over it all? I'm making the best of things!~
@1752 = ~You make it sound like you *wish* I would die.~
@1753 = ~'Tis not my wish to upset you. I only wish... Alas, I do not even know my own mind in this, my raven. Perhaps I needed only to voice my thoughts and hear what you might say.~
@1754 = ~Perhaps. Or perhaps we are not making enough of it. Either way, I doubt dwelling upon it longer will serve any purpose.~
@1755 = ~Nay, my raven. Even should I desire to part ways with you, I would not do so. Not for all the wealth in Sigil. Not even for Sigil itself.~
@1756 = ~I know not why, but I believe I need you at my side as well. The thought of being parted from you now... 'Tis not my desire in the least, I assure you.~
@1757 = ~Usefulness expires, that is inevitable. Whether 'tis you or I who do the casting aside is yet to be seen, my hound.~
@1758 = ~'Tis little comfort to my current state of mind, but I suppose you are correct.~
@1759 = ~You are young, foolish and brash. All the more reason you should not remain thus unscathed by life, and yet here you are.~
@1760 = ~What? No! Never, my raven. You are no beast in my eyes, nor shall you ever be. But neither are you what you seem to be on the surface. This I have always known, but never really *seen* until recent days.~
@1761 = ~Perhaps you should not be so quick to dismiss the unpleasantness of reality for the joys of your wishful thinking. You cannot ignore yourself, my raven!~
@1762 = ~Only a fool would say such a thing.~
@1763 = ~This is absurd. I should never have spoken. Let us fly, my raven, and forget these idle words and loose lips.~
@1764 = ~Radiant. Captivating. 'Tis what you are, my raven, and each day you grow ever more so.~
@1765 = ~(sigh) I cannot keep up with your mood swings.~
@1766 = ~Oh? Tell me more.~
@1767 = ~Is this your idea of an apology?~
@1768 = ~You don't need to do this, Haer'Dalis.~
@1769 = ~Strange. Someone recently told me I was terrifying. He looked an awful lot like you. Blue hair and everything.~
@1770 = ~Waste your flattery on someone who cares, bard.~
@1771 = ~Hah! 'Tis usually my line. Odd to hear you direct it at this sparrow.~
@1772 = ~Your charm won't save you this time, Haer'Dalis.~
@1773 = ~You think you can just toss out a few flowery lines and I'll forget all about the things you said the last time we spoke?~
@1774 = ~Haer'Dalis, you don't need to do this.~
@1775 = ~So you aren't still upset with me?~
@1776 = ~I'm surprised you aren't too terrified to look me in the eye, considering how frightened you are of me.~
@1777 = ~Leave me be, fool.~
@1778 = ~Oh? That has yet to be seen. I have oft proven capable of charming myself out of a great many things others swore were nigh impossible.~
@1779 = ~Something like that, aye.~
@1780 = ~To what do you refer, I wonder? If you mean I have no need to flatter you with truths, I fear I must disagree. 'Tis a pleasant way to open any conversation, even one with such potential to go awry.~
@1781 = ~My dear <CHARNAME>... no.~
@1782 = ~Ah. This look on your face is surely a sign that this conversation will not go well regardless of what I say, aye?~
@1783 = ~Please, give me but a moment before you storm off in a huff.~
@1784 = ~What I am soon to say is not often the sort of compliment a man offers a woman, but the thing which I admire in you most is your strength. There is power in you like nothing I've experienced before. Your eyes are ablaze with it, commanding attention. The way you walk, even the way you stand, all of this speaks of the greatness within you.~
@1785 = ~Wow. How long have you been working on that load of tripe?~
@1786 = ~I'm not listening to this, Haer'Dalis! You don't get to just charm your way out of all that 'you terrify me' nonsense!~
@1787 = ~Thank you.~
@1788 = ~You forgot to add 'terrifying,' 'frightening,' and all those other lovely epithets you used to describe me.~
@1789 = ~Oh, not terribly long. Actors are trained to improvise, after all.~
@1790 = ~Whatever makes you think I wish to apologize for anything?~
@1791 = ~Are you kidding?~
@1792 = ~I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that you don't feel at all bad for the things you said.~
@1793 = ~I'm not speaking to you until you apologize.~
@1794 = ~If not an apology, what *do* you want to say?~
@1795 = ~Ah... no?~
@1796 = ~Very well. I am deeply sorry... that you think it necessary for me to apologize.~
@1797 = ~Then my dashing doppelganger was correct - you *are* frightening. Does that mean fear is the only thing I feel when I look upon you? Surely you do not believe it is so.~
@1798 = ~Then tell me what else you feel.~
@1799 = ~I'm not listening to this, Haer'Dalis! You don't get to just charm your way out of everything you said!~
@1800 = ~I feel... perplexed. Captivated. Curious and frustrated.~
@1801 = ~I wonder what it would be like to taste your lips, to hear you sigh my name in the dark of night, to wake with your scent on my skin.~
@1802 = ~You are a constant source of mystery. I solve one, only to find you ready to present me with eleven more. I cannot get enough of you, and 'tis not a need I am accustomed to feeling.~
@1803 = ~Ah... all that, huh?~
@1804 = ~That was beautiful.~
@1805 = ~I feel... perplexed. Enthralled. Trapped and overeager and liberated by turn!~
@1806 = ~Your kisses burn with the sweetest fire, the touch of your skin follows me even into my sleep, and I ache when my hands cannot find you.~
@1807 = ~Aye, all that and so much more.~
@1808 = ~It was truth. 'Twas not some vain flattery, I assure you. Not this time.~
@1809 = ~I spoke my mind when last we traded words. I meant all I said, and I shall not deceive you by pretending to repent of some perceived slight upon your person.~
@1810 = ~But that does not mean it was wise for me to let my mouth run away with itself. I should not have thrown all that at your feet. You've enough on your mind to sink a thousand ships, and 'tis a disservice to you and selfish of me to add more to your burden.~
@1811 = ~Very well. I understand.~
@1812 = ~Thank you for being honest with me.~
@1813 = ~That's all you have to say?~
@1814 = ~It wasn't selfish. You're allowed to have feelings, Haer'Dalis.~
@1815 = ~I don't know if that's enough. I trusted you, and now I feel like I don't know who you are anymore.~
@1816 = ~Save your excuses. I want nothing more to do with you than necessary. Whatever might have been between us is gone.~
@1817 = ~Well, that was easy!~
@1818 = ~Yes, it was.~
@1819 = ~Should I play hard to get?~
@1820 = ~It wasn't as though we were fighting. It was a small thing, nothing more.~
@1821 = ~I just don't want to argue anymore.~
@1822 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. Have I told you before now that you are a most rare bird? Because you most assuredly are, one I am delighted to have at my side.~
@1823 = ~I would be lying if I said I did not enjoy a woman who puts up a good chase, but in this moment, I do believe I am most appreciative of your candor.~
@1824 = ~And so you wish to drop the subject. Very well, consider it dropped.~
@1825 = ~Hah, this sparrow is a bit too honest at times, raven. Would you have me any other way?~
@1826 = ~No, I prefer you as you are.~
@1827 = ~Honesty is good, but maybe you can take the drama down a few levels.~
@1828 = ~*Are* you honest? How would I know? You're an actor, Haer'Dalis, and I'm not foolish enough to believe you don't use your skills on me.~
@1829 = ~I could do with a little less honesty.~
@1830 = ~I'm sick of honesty. Some blind delusions would be a welcome change.~
@1831 = ~That is perhaps the kindest compliment anyone has paid this sparrow in all my long years. Thank you, my <CHARNAME>.~
@1832 = ~Hah! Oh, you are serious? Apologies, but that is highly unlikely, my dear.~
@1833 = ~Oh, you clever little minx. Tell me, how might a poor humble bard reply to such an accusation in a way that would not bring more down upon his frail head? Ah, but it is good to know your tongue remains sharp, my dear one.~
@1834 = ~Many things am I, and many things can I be, but if you ask me to be your trickster, to pull the wool over your own eyes... My raven, I do not believe I could do such a thing. Not to you. Not even if you wish it.~
@1835 = ~What more would you have from me, my raven?~
@1836 = ~Take me in your arms, kiss me, reassure me, *something*!~
@1837 = ~An actual apology would be nice.~
@1838 = ~I think you need to grovel. Yes, definitely grovel.~
@1839 = ~Just say we won't have another conversation like this.~
@1840 = ~You cannot fathom how much I long to do just that and so much more, but I do not wish to push anything upon you that you are not ready for. I--~
@1841 = ~(The tiefling gently catches your arm and lifts your hand, baring the inner pulse point of your wrist to press a soft, linging kiss against your skin. Without meeting your eyes, he pulls you close into an almost embrace, and brushes a second kiss across the slope of one cheek. His voice is a warm purr in your ear.)~
@1842 = ~I would stay like this for hours, days if you'd but allow it. I am here, my sweet raven. You've but to reach out and take me.~
@1843 = ~(Embrace him.)~
@1844 = ~(Lace your fingers with his.)~
@1845 = ~(Remain perfectly still.)~
@1846 = ~(Step away from him.)~
@1847 = ~This is neither the time nor the place for this.~
@1848 = ~Mmm... You see? We fit together far better than we should, perhaps. This is indeed a delightful way to make conversation.~
@1849 = ~Ah, you see how well our hands are suited to one another? Like pieces of a puzzle, fitted together with ease.~
@1850 = ~I shall take that as my cue to back away slowly. Never shall I rush you, raven. Some things are worth waiting for.~
@1851 = ~As I suspected, but I am patient. Some things are worth waiting for.~
@1852 = ~Then you should not have started it, my dear hound.~
@1853 = ~(Haer'Dalis moves before you have even finished speaking, his lips swallowing your last syllable in a demanding kiss. His hands frame your face as he murmurs soft words you cannot quite hear before he draws back a bit and meets your gaze.)~
@1854 = ~Always, without question. You need not even ask. You have but to look at me with those glittering eyes, and I am undone again and again. Here, let me hold you as we speak. 'Tis a pleasant way to converse, is it not?~
@1855 = ~I do not believe I could conjure up an apology that would satisfy you at this juncture. And so I shall not try.~
@1856 = ~Tsk, but 'tis such a chore. And my knees do get so filthy when I beg. No, perhaps later, my raven. In private.~
@1857 = ~I am unsure I can make that into a promise, but I can assure you that I too have little desire to see this repeated. I can only hope that is sufficient.~
@1858 = ~Aye, glad am I to hear you say that, but it was still unfair to you.~
@1859 = ~Perhaps a little.~
@1860 = ~I'm strong enough to handle it, I assure you.~
@1861 = ~Nonsense. We all have our moments.~
@1862 = ~Let's just put it behind us.~
@1863 = ~You are far too kind for your own good. Surely you know this.~
@1864 = ~Aye, this I well know. 'Tis one of the things about you I find most alluring.~
@1865 = ~'Tis true. Some of us more than others, aye?~
@1866 = ~I am the same sparrow as I've ever been, my <CHARNAME>. It saddens me to have hurt you, but I do not know how I can remedy the situation further.~
@1867 = ~Just say we won't have another conversation like that, and I'll let it go.~
@1868 = ~But I--~
@1869 = ~If you are certain that is your wish, then nothing more have we to say.~
@1870 = ~You may not realize it, but you are changing, my darling raven. Everyday I see it more clearly. 'Tis something to be celebrated, this shifting and growing within you that both terrifies and thrills this humble bard, but it is something this Doomguard still cannot comprehend. I am ill accustomed to discovering any mystery which I cannot unravel.~
@1871 = ~I can't possibly be the first thing you've come across that defies your understanding.~
@1872 = ~I suppose it would be awkward to come across someone who defies everything you know to be true.~
@1873 = ~Maybe that's because your so-called 'truths' aren't as absolute as you see them to be.~
@1874 = ~That's because your philosophy is a load of rubbish.~
@1875 = ~Will this come between us?~
@1876 = ~Perhaps not. Perhaps it is only because you and I have grown so close that I can see these oddities so clearly, and am thus deeply affected by them.~
@1877 = ~'Awkward' does not begin to describe it. You make me question the very things I'd once called answers. Nothing is changed, and yet...~
@1878 = ~You could be right. I do not think you are, but anything seems possible at this moment.~
@1879 = ~One anomaly does not a pattern make, my dear. My faith is not shaken, merely... tilted on its side.~
@1880 = ~Oh, no more than any other of the dozens of wedges that could come between us, I'm sure. Worry not, fair one. If anything, I am more intrigued by you now than I was before, and I have no thought in my head to part ways with you any day soon.~
@1881 = ~Ah, but I had a purpose when my lips first chose to speak, and let me get to the point before I lose it entirely.~
@1882 = ~Long ago did I learn that there are always pleasant ways to deliver even the worst of news. I cannot always promise to say sweet things, for surely by now you realize that this tongue of mine has a mind all its own, but I do swear that I shall do all in my power to keep from losing myself to worries again. And even my most dire of declarations shall be softened by honest and adoring verses. Does that suit you, oh raven of my heart?~
@1883 = ~Raven of your heart, am I?~
@1884 = ~That's fine, Haer'Dalis.~
@1885 = ~I suppose it'll have to do.~
@1886 = ~There's no chance I can just muzzle you and be done with your babbling completely?~
@1887 = ~You're getting emotionally attached to me in ways I'm not comfortable with.~
@1888 = ~Whatever you say, bard. Let's go.~
@1889 = ~Very much so.~
@1890 = ~No, I fear I'm terribly skilled at escaping any attempt to saddle my tongue. Surely you can forgive me.~
@1891 = ~If you wish to put distance between us, all you need do is say the word and off I shall fly to fairer roosts.~
@1892 = ~Will you take my arm and walk with me a spell? I've the sudden need for your constant touch, my <CHARNAME>.~
@1893 = ~From an orphan girl sheltered away inside a library of dust and stone, to the battle-hardened woman who stands before me. Tell me truly, raven, does it ever overwhelm you? To look at how far you've come in so very little time?~
@1894 = ~Oh, all the time! I never could have imagined I'd see and do so many unbelievable things.~
@1895 = ~Sometimes, I suppose.~
@1896 = ~I haven't really thought about it.~
@1897 = ~Not at all. I always knew I was destined for something more.~
@1898 = ~Why do you want to know?~
@1899 = ~This sparrow is inclined to suggest that you should improve upon your imagination's limits. Surely your childhood contained lessons in matters more dangerous than rat catching and dutiful study of archaic tomes? You must have had some hint that your life would change.~
@1900 = ~No, not really. The most exciting thing I expected to experience was the day I outgrew my chores and Gorion passed them off to someone younger. I was really looking forward to that day, actually...~
@1901 = ~I suppose there were signs, but I didn't really have anything to compare it to, so how was I to even recognize what I was seeing?~
@1902 = ~The truth was plain enough to see, but I was very nave .~
@1903 = ~It was easier to pretend like everything was normal.~
@1904 = ~I should have known I was destined for greater things.~
@1905 = ~Hah! And I imagine it would be a relief to trade some of your current tasks for a few of those menial labors, aye? Ah, the arrogance of youth, always believing life will be so much better once adulthood is achieved.~
@1906 = ~'Tis easy to be blind to that which we do not wish to see. And life often becomes less than easy when the truth comes to light in all its painful splendor, aye?~
@1907 = ~All children have some bloated sense of self importance, so I fail to see how a misplaced notion of 'destiny' could be a true sign of future greatness.~
@1908 = ~So calm and practical you are. I believe you were born to weather this life of constant change, for few creatures could take things in stride as you do.~
@1909 = ~The realms could use more calm, practical people to balance the madness of everyone else.~
@1910 = ~I don't know about all that, but I see little purpose in getting myself riled up about anything and everything.~
@1911 = ~Eh, it's not like I can change anything, so why bother worrying?~
@1912 = ~Calm? Me? Hah! You must have taken a few too many blows to the head, Haer'Dalis.~
@1913 = ~I don't appreciate your sarcasm, bard.~
@1914 = ~I must say, it sounds decidedly less interesting when you put it that way, my dull raven.~
@1915 = ~Oh, believe you me, I could not agree more. 'Twould be a tragic amount of energy wasted on a fruitless endeavor.~
@1916 = ~My dear, there is a gaping chasm betwixt practicality and apathy. Be wary lest you fall in and be swallowed whole, aye?~
@1917 = ~There is no need to draw more attention than necessary to that which is painfully obvious, is there?~
@1918 = ~Oh, you picked up on that? Either you have grown more perceptive, or my wit has dulled with age. What a pity.~
@1919 = ~Why not?~
@1920 = ~I'd rather not dwell on it.~
@1921 = ~Laziness, I'd say. Introspection can be so draining.~
@1922 = ~With all that's happened, there's been no time for reflection.~
@1923 = ~Why make the effort? You examine me often enough for the both of us, Haer'Dalis.~
@1924 = ~My thoughts are none of your business.~
@1925 = ~Truly it can, my dear raven. 'Tis fortunate you have this sparrow at your side to provide you with much-needed and oft-ignored perspective.~
@1926 = ~Such a flimsy excuse, my raven. Should you not by now have grown accustomed to this wild lifestyle you insist on leading? It seems logical that you'd learn to balance it all eventually.~
@1927 = ~You think so, do you? Perhaps 'tis only my own pride speaking, but I find it very likely that you'd be most put out should I keep my examinations to myself.~
@1928 = ~Oh, indeed? Then mayhap you should guard them more carefully, my hound.~
@1929 = ~Destined for something more than what, precisely?~
@1930 = ~Something more than silence? Solitude? Loneliness?~
@1931 = ~More than dusty books and boring old men.~
@1932 = ~More than Gorion's cage.~
@1933 = ~Perhaps 'more' isn't the right word, but rather something *other*, something very much *not* Candlekeep.~
@1934 = ~Even I don't know yet. Just something... more.~
@1935 = ~I'm destined for something greater than you are, that much I know.~
@1936 = ~Is that how you felt in the long days before your journey began? My dear, take my hand. I assure, while this sparrow yet draws breath, you are not alone.~
@1937 = ~My raven, it would be my hope that nearly everyone is destined for something greater than that! How horribly dull you make it sound!~
@1938 = ~Careful, my raven, lest you wake one day to find that you've done nothing but fly directly from one cage into the open gates of another. This sparrow has suffered just such a fate, and 'twas my own blindness to blame.~
@1939 = ~I can well understand the burning itch that comes from being too long in a place that does not suit you. Aye, we are much alike in that, dear raven.~
@1940 = ~'Tis one thing to wander as this sparrow does, dear one, but perhaps 'twould be wise to put *some* thought into your next step?~
@1941 = ~Hah! My hound, the only destiny that awaits this sparrow is death, so 'tis not much to say that you aspire to more!~
@1942 = ~Ah, my dulcet darling, I shall never tire of being subjected to your suspicious glances. What vile trickery do you believe me up to now?~
@1943 = ~I wasn't being suspicious. I just wondered what your motivation was.~
@1944 = ~What a defensive reply from the perfectly innocent tiefling...~
@1945 = ~If I always suspect something, I'll never have to worry about being surprised.~
@1946 = ~You're always up to something!~
@1947 = ~Ah, my mistake. Truth be told, I was merely attempting to strike up a conversation with my lovely leader. Nothing more, nothing less.~
@1948 = ~Nonsense. I would never lay claim to perfect innocence. Charmingly flawed innocence, perhaps, but never perfect.~
@1949 = ~True. And if you constantly stare at the shadows waiting for them to leap upon you, never shall you need worry that anyone will mistake you for sane.~
@1950 = ~Tsk, and you say this as though I should be ashamed of it!~
@1951 = ~I have of late pondered this driven nature of yours, this fire that burns so bright behind your eyes, and from where precisely it comes. Given what I know of you, I've come to believe that it is not wholly a product of this dead-god father of yours.~
@1952 = ~But you do believe it comes at least in some part from Bhaal?~
@1953 = ~You seem to see a lot of unusual things when you look at me.~
@1954 = ~Of course it doesn't come from Bhaal.~
@1955 = ~I think you're right.~
@1956 = ~I'm not so sure. I wouldn't be surprised if somehow removing the taint left me empty and lifeless.~
@1957 = ~What fire are you talking about?~
@1958 = ~It's not something I want to talk about.~
@1959 = ~Surely it must, would you not agree? I admit that I have little enough familiarity with the bastard children of lesser deities as a whole, but one would think that this seemingly-endless wellspring of strength within you is at least partially the result of such parentage.~
@1960 = ~Yet, you don't think my strength comes fully from my blood?~
@1961 = ~My power does not come from Bhaal.~
@1962 = ~I wouldn't be surprised if somehow removing the taint left me empty and lifeless.~
@1963 = ~What 'endless wellspring of strength' are you talking about?~
@1964 = ~Some part of it does, and perhaps that is the root of it, or simply the place from which it all sprang forth. But when I look upon you, my <CHARNAME>, I do not see an empty husk filled with some foreign power.~
@1965 = ~You are unique in my experience, and my experience is rather extensive, if I do say so myself, and so why should I not comment on the things I see? Perhaps you simply fail to recognize just how interesting you truly are.~
@1966 = ~Do not be foolish. 'Tis like this sparrow saying 'the color of my hair did not come from my father.' I do not deny that Bhaal is but a part of that which is within you, but our parents are always an influence upon us, whether we believe so or not. Or whether we wish it or not.~
@1967 = ~Ah! How I do adore those words from your lips, my precious raven.~
@1968 = ~My raven, I find such an image of you deeply worrying. I sincerely hope you are never given the opportunity to find out if your dire proclamation is true.~
@1969 = ~Something inside you does not allow you to give up, regardless of the odds. You fought onward after the murder of your mentor, braved assassins and dark paths that make even this wandering poet shiver to imagine. Few have I met who could drag themselves from a dungeon of horrors with naught but the clothes on their back and survive, never mind *thriving* as you have!~
@1970 = ~Perhaps I am a fool, but I cannot find it in myself to attribute all you've accomplished to some dead god.~
@1971 = ~You should be proud of how far you've come, regardless of your motivations and means of getting here. Though I doubt you are satisfied with the view from where you now stand, it is a place I do not believe any other could have claimed through the same trials and tribulations.~
@1972 = ~I have accomplished a lot, haven't I? Despite it all, I am rather proud of how far I've come.~
@1973 = ~I couldn't have come so far without you at my side.~
@1974 = ~True, I'm not satisfied with where things are now, but it's better than where I started. That's something.~
@1975 = ~You give me too much credit.~
@1976 = ~I can't let myself relax, not even for a moment. There is still so much to be done.~
@1977 = ~Are you done licking my boots? Can we get moving?~
@1978 = ~And well you should be! Though we would both be wise to keep it all in perspective and remember that there is much yet to come.~
@1979 = ~Oh, what nonsense. Lovely, kind, and flattering nonsense, the sort which I deeply appreciate, but nonsense nonetheless. My blades and I are happy to serve you, dear raven.~
@1980 = ~Aye, every step forward is progress, is it not?~
@1981 = ~And you give yourself not enough. If you do not wish to properly appreciate yourself, that is not something I can correct, but you cannot stop me from admiring you. And glad I am for that!~
@1982 = ~My raven, you worry me in moments like this.~
@1983 = ~Aye, as you wish, my dark hound.~
@1984 = ~Many years have I lived, far more than you have seen in your short time, and even I at times find myself speechless to realize how far it is I've come. Never could I have predicted that I would find myself on the Prime, standing beside a powerful half-goddess, chewing over idle, ill-formed philosophy between battles. Hah!~
@1985 = ~You should laugh more often. It suits you, my sparrow.~
@1986 = ~Why does that make you laugh?~
@1987 = ~I'm glad you're here.~
@1988 = ~You couldn't have predicted it because it's farfetched, or you couldn't have predicted it because you never think much about the future anyway?~
@1989 = ~I could make do with a bit less philosophy myself.~
@1990 = ~Ah, my radiant raven. I feel much the same when laughter breaks loose from your lips.~
@1991 = ~You've made me a happy bird, my dear. Come and share smiles with me but a while longer.~
@1992 = ~Why not? You and I could both use more laughter in our lives.~
@1993 = ~And glad I am to be here, even when I do not seem grateful.~
@1994 = ~Have I told you how much I adore your devious mind, dear raven?~
@1995 = ~Aye, that is all the answer you shall get from me.~
@1996 = ~In exchange for what? More blood, murder and mayhem? Our talks are the spice of your life, and nothing you say shall persuade me otherwise!~
@1997 = ~All this talk, it does make one think about just how much can change in, say, a year? A few months? A week? Where will you be when next you think back on your life? Where will *I* be? These are not thoughts I often entertain, but they prove amusing enough, aye?~
@1998 = ~All life is born to die. All things fade. All that is vibrant falls to decay. There are no exceptions to this truth. Not even you, my raven, can hide from this one and only universal destiny.~
@1999 = ~You say that as if I don't already know it.~
@2000 = ~So you claim.~
@2001 = ~Perhaps.~
@2002 = ~Ah, I see you're in a cheerful mood today.~
@2003 = ~Don't spout your philosophy at me.~
@2004 = ~How do you expect me to respond to that, Haer'Dalis?~
@2005 = ~I will prove you wrong, bard.~
@2006 = ~So you agree? You believe as I do that eventually all of this will catch you up, that regardless of how you appear on occasion, you are in fact as mortal as any other?~
@2007 = ~Of course I do!~
@2008 = ~I've never laid claim to the qualities you seem so keen to see in me. The only person saying I'm something more than mortal is you.~
@2009 = ~Honestly, I just don't know.~
@2010 = ~I'm not saying I agree with you. I was just pointing out that you've told me all this already.~
@2011 = ~I do not see the truth you claim to recognize when I look in your eyes. Ready yourself for what is to come. It will not be more of this same seeming-immortality that clings to your tender flesh, no.~
@2012 = ~So you wish to play the fool in this awkward musical of ours, do you? No, I shall not allow you so easy an escape. You *must* be made to understand.~
@2013 = ~And to that I can find only one reply: 'Tis not enough. I cannot leave it at that, not without something more from you. If I do not try...~
@2014 = ~Aye, and I shall claim it again and again, for it is truth and cannot be denied!~
@2015 = ~Who are you trying to convince? Me or you?~
@2016 = ~If that's what you believe, it's not my place to argue.~
@2017 = ~There's no need to get upset. I understand what you're trying to say.~
@2018 = ~It sounds like a load of rubbish to me.~
@2019 = ~I've had absolutely enough of your fickle moods, bard! Leave me be!~
@2020 = ~I warn you, do not attempt to play mind games with me, young raven. I have been through more than even you can boast, and I have seen the truth firsthand over and over, unfailing and constant. I do not speak of these things because I wish to sway you to some religion or doctrine, and you would be a fool to dismiss my words.~
@2021 = ~Then I shall leave you to your worthless barking, my dark hound.~
@2022 = ~No, there is no 'perhaps' about it. It is truth, *pure* truth, regardless of what you believe.~
@2023 = ~I cannot exchange witty banter with you this time, <CHARNAME>. My heart is burdened with too many cares to find its wings.~
@2024 = ~Philosophy has nothing to do with this, and I speak not as a Doomguard but as a man whose eyes see the truth!~
@2025 = ~Your willful arrogance cannot undo that which is set in stone. You are *mortal* and entropy *will* catch you up!~
@2026 = ~I wish you to be prepared. I wish you to acknowledge that you are as frail as any other bird! I...~
@2027 = ~I fear what waits for you.~
@2028 = ~I promise you, I am prepared for what is to come.~
@2029 = ~You fear what waits for me? You? The man who revels in decay and dances just out of death's reach?~
@2030 = ~Are you second guessing your beliefs because of me?~
@2031 = ~That makes no sense. You want me to acknowledge that I will decay and die, yet you're afraid for me?~
@2032 = ~I don't need your concern.~
@2033 = ~If that is true, then this sparrow is relieved, albeit only a little. I suppose I have no choice but to take your word at face value.~
@2034 = ~Either I am not making myself clear, or you are willfully misunderstanding my words.~
@2035 = ~While I must admit that some of the things I have seen in you at times have thoroughly tested my understanding, truthfully being at your side has only proven time and again what this Doomguard's heart has always known.~
@2036 = ~It is not your death that I fear, my raven. It is your continued defiance of the natural decay of all things that worries this sparrow. You are not immortal, and your fall when entropy comes for you will be great indeed if you are ignorant of its approach.~
@2037 = ~Are you suggesting there's something I can do to lessen the impact of this 'decay?' I thought you said it was complete and inevitable for all things.~
@2038 = ~I know I'm not immortal, Haer'Dalis.~
@2039 = ~What if I am immortal? What if I continue to fight and win, defying this so-called 'entropy' of yours?~
@2040 = ~I really don't understand what you're trying to tell me, but it's nice to know you care.~
@2041 = ~Thank you for your concern.~
@2042 = ~Yet you have it, much to my continued consternation.~
@2043 = ~Aye, that is true. 'Tis not that you could avoid the full effect of entropy on your life, but with preparation and acceptance, you might be less shattered by it when it comes. Given it doesn't kill you outright, of course.~
@2044 = ~I understand. You don't want to see me broken.~
@2045 = ~So you'd rather see me dead than see me damaged. Is that what you're saying?~
@2046 = ~No. A thousand times, no. Yours is a heart not easily torn asunder, much like my own, but I do not know if I could suffer to see you broken. 'Tis a devastating thought.~
@2047 = ~If you wish to put it in such crude terms, then yes, that is what I am saying! Yours is a heart not easily torn asunder, much like my own, but I do not know if I could suffer to see you broken. 'Twould be better to see you empty than see you destroyed!~
@2048 = ~For now. But will you say the same tomorrow, or in a year if we yet live?~
@2049 = ~For how long, my hound? Let us pretend you *are* immortal, a god even! Will you reign forever? How well did that work out for the dust of your father?~
@2050 = ~Are you done ranting?~
@2051 = ~I never claimed to be a god.~
@2052 = ~I am not Bhaal!~
@2053 = ~Is it so easy for you to dismiss all I've been through? I shouldn't be alive, yet I am! Is that not the definition of immortality?~
@2054 = ~You mock my concern. Perhaps I should not be surprised.~
@2055 = ~You entertain thoughts of immortality but deny aspirations of godhood? Most creatures would call immortality a defining trait of any god, but perhaps they are all wrong.~
@2056 = ~That has yet to be seen.~
@2057 = ~Surviving near impossible odds is not the same as immortality! If I drove my sword through your chest, you would surely die! You bleed, you tire, you must eat and drink. My raven, please do not let your success blind you.~
@2058 = ~Did you think I do not care? Have I not made myself plain enough?~
@2059 = ~Lust and affection are two different matters.~
@2060 = ~There's something more than desire in your touch.~
@2061 = ~You've made it clear that you care, and I'm grateful for it.~
@2062 = ~What does it matter if you care? Won't that just decay and die, too?~
@2063 = ~Well, you aren't all that easy to understand at times.~
@2064 = ~It's hard to know when you're acting and when you're being sincere.~
@2065 = ~No, you've been downright evasive. Tell me plainly how much you care.~
@2066 = ~I carry both for you, my <CHARNAME>. But this is not the time for such talk.~
@2067 = ~Indeed, you are perceptive. But this is not the time for such talk.~
@2068 = ~Glad I am to hear it, though it does not calm my worries.~
@2069 = ~Aye, it will. But should we all be strangled at birth simply because we will someday submit to death? Should affection be scorned because it will someday fade? I should hope not.~
@2070 = ~I know. And I find that often the more I try to make myself understood, the worse off we all are.~
@2071 = ~Aye, that I cannot argue. At times I often fool myself and know not which is real and which is fantasy. Maudlin thoughts, those.~
@2072 = ~I care enough to be afraid for you. Is that not enough?~
@2073 = ~I know not which is worse - this hint of fear that you shall prove false all that I've ever known to be true, or the gnawing certainty that entropy lurks in your shadow, waiting to tear you to pieces even while you refuse to see it.~
@2074 = ~You are a torment to me, my hound. And I am cruel to myself. Nothing more have I to sing. Let us away.~
@2075 = ~A moment, my raven. I've something to ask of you.~
@2076 = ~I must know how your tale ends. 'Tis like a craving I cannot satisfy, this longing in me to see this one thing through. I beg you, send me not away until this bard's curiosity is sated.~
@2077 = ~You're asking *me* to stay with *you*? I always thought it would be the other way around.~
@2078 = ~You expect me to send you away?~
@2079 = ~And when your curiosity is sated... you'll leave?~
@2080 = ~What if my tale doesn't end for a very long time?~
@2081 = ~You're always welcome at my side, Haer'Dalis.~
@2082 = ~I make no promises.~
@2083 = ~I doubt I'll tolerate your presence much longer.~
@2084 = ~Mayhap someday our places will be reversed, but at this moment there is nothing I wish more than to remain at your side.~
@2085 = ~I'm not satisfied with that arrangement.~
@2086 = ~I suppose that's all you can offer me.~
@2087 = ~And I'm glad to have you at my side now.~
@2088 = ~I have no intention of sending you away.~
@2089 = ~What arrangement would you then have instead?~
@2090 = ~Something more than some fading, doomed-to-fail, momentary *thing*!~
@2091 = ~I hate being afraid that I'll wake up one day and you'll just be gone.~
@2092 = ~I don't really know, if I have to be honest.~
@2093 = ~Forgive me. I know you well enough to know what you can and cannot give by now, and it's foolish of me to expect something different.~
@2094 = ~One I'm sure you cannot provide.~
@2095 = ~I know not what to make of this 'doomed-to-fail' bit, for surely that would depend upon the definition of 'failure,' would it not? But to your other complaints, I must point out that all things are momentary and fading. Why would you expect anything between us to be otherwise?~
@2096 = ~(sigh) Why indeed.~
@2097 = ~Because love is supposed to be a forever thing! Isn't it?~
@2098 = ~I thought we might have something unique between us.~
@2099 = ~The more we talk, the more I realize that we're very different people, Haer'Dalis.~
@2100 = ~I think you and I are very bad for one another.~
@2101 = ~Oh, just forget I said anything!~
@2102 = ~I gather my words have brought you disappointment, and for that I am truly sorry. I've no wish to bring you unhappiness.~
@2103 = ~You will not care for my answer, but surely it will come as no surprise, *Nothing* is forever, <CHARNAME>. Nor should it be.~
@2104 = ~At the risk of unintentionally misleading you on the chance that we are not speaking on equal terms, I have to admit that I *do* believe there is something unique between us. Just because something will fade over time does not make it any less worthwhile or wonderful. Quite the contrary, in my opinion.~
@2105 = ~I've never truly understood that phrase, I think. Are not all creatures 'very different' from one another? 'Twould seem a terribly dull thing indeed if all of us walked around agreeing with each other all day.~
@2106 = ~Are we? Aye, perhaps we are.~
@2107 = ~Put that fear from your mind, dear <CHARNAME>. Surely you do not believe me to be a coward who would slip out in the night! Many things am I, but this sparrow has never been that sort of man.~
@2108 = ~Forgive me, I didn't mean to insult you.~
@2109 = ~No, I suppose that isn't really your style.~
@2110 = ~Despite everything, we really haven't known each other very long. I'm not sure what you're capable of.~
@2111 = ~You're an actor. You could be lying through your teeth right now.~
@2112 = ~Judging by what I know about you, it seems perfectly possible.~
@2113 = ~I'd hope not. Because I'd have to hunt you down and make you suffer for such a betrayal.~
@2114 = ~There is nothing to forgive, my dear one. It is entirely likely that I've given just that exact impression on an occasion or two, and for that I've only myself to blame.~
@2115 = ~No, taking my leave without a fuss is truly not my way. I prefer something with a bit more flair, something more... dramatic.~
@2116 = ~And I know not what *you* are capable of, my half-goddess. That is part of the allure, though, is it not? The thrill of new discovery, both on the horizon and right here beside us?~
@2117 = ~That I could. Why, I once persuaded a cornugon that his singing voice was so beautiful that he could enchant the Lady of Pain herself! I nearly convinced him to leave the Blood War behind to pursue a life on the stage, but alas, my master slew the poor fool before he could make up his mind. Ah, I've not thought of those days in many years...~
@2118 = ~Then I judge that you know very little of me, my hound.~
@2119 = ~Aye, of this I am well aware, my fearsome friend. 'Tis almost worth attempting it just to experience the thrill of being hunted by you, but I think mayhap there are better thrills to be found if I yet remain at your side.~
@2120 = ~I think perhaps we are more alike in this than I wish to admit. A part of me understands this wanting for more that you speak of, even as another part of me knows it is impossible in every way.~
@2121 = ~Please don't tell me it's impossible. I don't want to hear that.~
@2122 = ~It's a relief to know that you understand.~
@2123 = ~Well, at least we have something in common.~
@2124 = ~Wonderful. Neither of us know what we want.~
@2125 = ~This is pointless. Just forget I said anything.~
@2126 = ~I think perhaps you misunderstand me, but I have little confidence that any explanation I offer will put your mind at ease.~
@2127 = ~I find it reassuring as well, dear <CHARNAME>.~
@2128 = ~Hah! I suspect we have more in common than this one thing.~
@2129 = ~Hah! Perhaps you should think of it thus: With less expectations, we've less disappointments to look forward to, aye?~
@2130 = ~Pointless? Hardly. But I shall not force the subject if you do not desire to speak of it.~
@2131 = ~'Tis not foolish to have your own wants and desires, my dear raven, but it is in many ways a relief that you know me this well.~
@2132 = ~It might be a relief to you, but it's hardly a relief to me!~
@2133 = ~I hope I get to know you even better in the future.~
@2134 = ~Someday you'll realize you can't live without me, then everything will be fine.~
@2135 = ~I'd make demands on you if I thought it'd do any good, but that would just push you away, wouldn't it?~
@2136 = ~I care for you. All of you. Even the bits I don't always agree with.~
@2137 = ~Was there some purpose to this discussion?~
@2138 = ~I know not how to ease your burden in this, and for that I am truly sorry.~
@2139 = ~Better than you already do? All of my alluring mystique scattered to the wind, and Haer'Dalis bared to his soul for <CHARNAME> to see? Oh, my raven, 'tis a terrifying thought, that!~
@2140 = ~Is that what you hope? I fear you might be disappointed, but only time will tell.~
@2141 = ~Would it? Since you know me so well, I'll leave the pondering of the answer to you.~
@2142 = ~My dear sweet <CHARNAME>... How can I possibly find a suitable reply for such a sentiment? I hope with all the sincerity in my heart that you know I feel the same for you.~
@2143 = ~Then one must wonder why you bother to mention it at all.~
@2144 = ~Forgive me for my unkind words. I did not mean them.~
@2145 = ~To goad you into trying harder, obviously.~
@2146 = ~I don't know why I brought it up.~
@2147 = ~You think I'd just come out and tell you my reasons? Oh, I don't think so.~
@2148 = ~Because it's the truth, and I tire of pretending otherwise.~
@2149 = ~Of course, my dear. There is much on your mind, and truly it is a wonder your temper doesn't run short more often.~
@2150 = ~Oh, is that the trick then? Ah. How... predictable.~
@2151 = ~Then I shall pay it no mind.~
@2152 = ~Oh-ho! I give you fair warning, <CHARNAME>, I am not often beaten in these sorts of games, though I do find great delight in them.~
@2153 = ~Then I shall offer you naught but a bow and silence, my hound.~
@2154 = ~Is there something more you would have of me?~
@2155 = ~Yes! I want something more than some fading, doomed-to-fail, momentary *thing*!~
@2156 = ~No, I know you well enough to know what you can and cannot give by now. It would be foolish of me to expect something different.~
@2157 = ~Many things. None of which you can provide.~
@2158 = ~I wonder at our seeming kindred spirits, my raven. Are you truly my mirror image, or do I fool myself? Or is it you doing the fooling? I do not think I wish to hear the answer, whatever it may be.~
@2159 = ~Perhaps it seems strange to you after all this time, but this sparrow is only mortal and does on occasion need certain reassurances. If death keeps its distance for a while yet, I hope to be at your side, at least until I know how all of this will end.~
@2160 = ~You really expect me to send you away?~
@2161 = ~And when you've seen the end and your curiosity is sated... you'll leave?~
@2162 = ~Truly, I do not know. It has been said that this sparrow is not the easiest bird with which to fly, certainly not for prolonged journeys. Perhaps you will tire of my singing, aye?~
@2163 = ~No, I don't think that will happen.~
@2164 = ~If anything, I think it's you who will tire of me.~
@2165 = ~I don't like to think too far ahead, so I can't really answer that.~
@2166 = ~I suppose it's possible.~
@2167 = ~Hah! That's an understatement! I've started stuffing straw in my ears to block out your constant chattering.~
@2168 = ~Oh, I'm sure I will someday.~
@2169 = ~Can this humble bard safely assume that this means you will tolerate my company for some time yet to come?~
@2170 = ~Let's just take it one day at a time.~
@2171 = ~Oh, I don't know. I think I'll let you sweat about this for a while.~
@2172 = ~Wise counsel, my dear raven.~
@2173 = ~You think to keep me captivated with this coy act of yours? It does not shame me in the least to admit that it is working.~
@2174 = ~I cannot lie and say that is not possible. It has been known to happen to this wayward sparrow from time to time, but I do not expect to find myself seeking other roosts any time soon.~
@2175 = ~And I'm supposed to be okay with the very real possibility that you'll grow bored with me?~
@2176 = ~If you expecting me to beg you to stay when that time comes...~
@2177 = ~You might want to look into those 'other roosts' because it's doubtful I'll keep you around long.~
@2178 = ~The likelihood that one or both of us will die gruesome deaths far before that day comes is exceedingly high. Perhaps it would be best not to dwell upon it, hmm?~
@2179 = ~No, I do not. You should beg no man for anything. And if you do intend to beg, I do not wish to hear of it now. 'Tis not an image with which I am entirely comfortable.~
@2180 = ~A wise way to approach the future, though you've cleverly avoided giving me any hints as to your disposition toward my prolonged companionship despite my best efforts at asking-without-asking.~
@2181 = ~But not likely in the immediate future, this sparrow hopes.~
@2182 = ~Listen well, my razor-tongued raven, there is surely some other half-blood godchild somewhere who would be delighted to listen to my inspiring tales! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to a moment more of your taunting... well, you're clearly correct, because here I stand.~
@2183 = ~Good. Because I plan to let you sweat about this for a while.~
@2184 = ~You're welcome at my side, Haer'Dalis.~
@2185 = ~An all too confident answer... and one that does not lend much hope to my initial query.~
@2186 = ~Hah! I think I'll let you sweat about this for a while.~
@2187 = ~'Tis a question for which I have no answer. Who's to say either of us will even survive that long?~
@2188 = ~And who's to say we won't?~
@2189 = ~True enough.~
@2190 = ~I should have expected an evasive answer.~
@2191 = ~If you won't give me a real answer, then this conversation is over.~
@2192 = ~Well, I *am* sorely tempted to kill you right now.~
@2193 = ~Hah, I suppose I should have seen that coming. We could happily play the 'what if' game for all eternity, or you could simply answer my question.~
@2194 = ~But, on the rapidly diminishing chance that we do indeed live on...~
@2195 = ~Aye, indeed you should have. But now it is you who avoid providing an answer.~
@2196 = ~As I will continue to do. I think I'll let you sweat about this for a while.~
@2197 = ~Was my answer somehow less than real? And 'twas I who asked the first! Am not I entitled to a 'real' answer, as you say?~
@2198 = ~No, not really. I think I'll let you sweat about this for a while.~
@2199 = ~Before you do, will you give me an answer?~
@2200 = ~No. I think I'll let you sweat about this for a while.~
@2201 = ~And what if it ends tomorrow? Does it matter how long it takes?~
@2202 = ~It does matter! It matters to me even if it doesn't matter to you!~
@2203 = ~You are sorely testing my patience, bard...~
@2204 = ~<CHARNAME>, that is not what I meant in the least. What must I say to make you understand?~
@2205 = ~Tell me you love me.~
@2206 = ~Just... I don't like all this talk of leaving and staying. Mostly the leaving parts.~
@2207 = ~If I knew that, we wouldn't be having this awkward conversation, would we?~
@2208 = ~There's nothing you can say.~
@2209 = ~Just forget it. I'm tired of talking.~
@2210 = ~Can you truly only hear those words if I speak them aloud?~
@2211 = ~Forgive me, my raven. We should get moving. Your future awaits you.~
@2212 = ~Fair enough, my <CHARNAME>. Time has a way of working out such troublesome details all on its own.~
@2213 = ~Hah! I suppose not, my clever raven. Perhaps we are cursed to simply never understand each other fully. But is that not the case in most all dealings between men and women?~
@2214 = ~If that is so, then I can only hope you do not think ill of me for it. Perhaps we are cursed to simply never understand each other fully. But is that not the case in most all dealings between men and women?~
@2215 = ~I understand, and I apologize if I've left you disappointed.~
@2216 = ~Come, say you will let this poor sparrow fly with you into the sunset!~
@2217 = ~You think you do not test mine? Frequently? You've not even answered my question!~
@2218 = ~And I have no intention of answering. I think I'll let you sweat about this for a while.~
@2219 = ~I ask, and you graciously grant my desire. Is it truly so simple?~
@2220 = ~It is indeed.~
@2221 = ~Should I have played coy and mysterious instead?~
@2222 = ~You're the one who makes things complicated, Haer'Dalis.~
@2223 = ~Maybe it's not as simple as I'm making it sound.~
@2224 = ~I'd be glad to make it terribly difficult, if you prefer.~
@2225 = ~Then I shall count myself fortunate and be glad!~
@2226 = ~Oh, I admit to having a weakness for such ploys, but I am not entirely dissatisfied with this direct approach.~
@2227 = ~I cannot argue that, for it is pure truth.~
@2228 = ~Oh? Now you've piqued my interest, devious one, even if you are bluffing.~
@2229 = ~That is a very alluring temptation, and were you any other woman, I would test that offer. But I think I will simply take what I can get in this case.~
@2230 = ~Aye, I suppose I should expect as much. After all, I myself make no promises.~
@2231 = ~Yet you ask for them.~
@2232 = ~You may not say them out loud, but you do make promises.~
@2233 = ~Then we have that in common.~
@2234 = ~Promises only lead to disappointments.~
@2235 = ~I would not necessarily say I sought a promise from you in this request, but perhaps you have a point. 'Twould seem I am just as double-minded as any other average mortal.~
@2236 = ~Mayhap you see what you wish to see, even if it is not there. Or perhaps I do not know myself as well as I ought.~
@2237 = ~And that is a beautiful thing, is it not?~
@2238 = ~Aye, this I've learned the hard way, as I suspect you have as well.~
@2239 = ~So you say, yet you've not cast me aside thus far. I think you find me far more charming than you are willing to admit.~
@2240 = ~You know I do.~
@2241 = ~Even if I do, I'm not going to let you know.~
@2242 = ~Bah. Maybe.~
@2243 = ~Isn't your ego already big enough without needing to hear flattery from me?~
@2244 = ~You're useful, Haer'Dalis. That's all.~
@2245 = ~Warming my bed is all you're good for.~
@2246 = ~Wrong. I don't.~
@2247 = ~Ah, and you admit it freely! Truly, I should note the date and time lest you forget your words and need reminding in the future.~
@2248 = ~I do so love it when you tease.~
@2249 = ~Your eyes are sparkling. Such a lovely sight.~
@2250 = ~Now that is nothing but rubbish, raven, and I shall not justify it with an answer.~
@2251 = ~Many men are useful, <CHARNAME>. You could easily replace me, yet you do not. Play the fool if you must, but do not expect me to go along with the ruse.~
@2252 = ~Only for the warming part? And here I thought I was good for so very many things in your bed... You've proclaimed it to be true rather loudly on at least one occasion.~
@2253 = ~Indeed? Time will tell, I suppose.~
@2254 = ~Ah, but listen to this bard ramble on like an old man! Perhaps it is foolish of me to seek a pointless assurance in a future that may very well never come, but...~
@2255 = ~Well, I've done many foolish things in your fair company, have I not? What's one more?~
@2256 = ~Let us fly on once again, oh raven of my heart, and see what, if anything, this future of yours has for us.~
