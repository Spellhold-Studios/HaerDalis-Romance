@2    = ~I want to ask you something about this book you wrote.~
@3    = ~Do you have a moment to talk?~
@4    = ~I think we need to talk about our relationship, Haer'Dalis.~
@5    = ~(Turn back to the task at hand.)~
@6    = ~(The tiefling appears to be lost in his own thoughts.)~
@7    = ~(Watch him.)~

@11   = ~(Play with his earrings.)~
@12   = ~(Play with his hair.)~
@13   = ~How fare you, my sparrow?~
@14   = ~I'm in the mood for a bit of poetry.~
@15   = ~(Trace the markings on his face with your fingertips.)~
@16   = ~(Kiss him.)~
@17   = ~(Embrace him.)~
@18   = ~(Push his hair behind his shoulder and rub the back of his neck.)~
@19   = ~I miss your touch, my sparrow. We should set camp soon, don't you think?~
@20   = ~I miss your touch, dear sparrow. We should set camp soon, don't you think?~
@21   = ~It's wonderful to have you at my side, Haer'Dalis.~
@22   = ~(sigh)~
@23   = ~When we rest on our travels, we ought to put our bedrolls together.~
@24   = ~Next time we rest at an inn, we should share a bed.~
@25   = ~Now, is there something else you need of this sparrow?~
@26   = ~No, let's keep moving.~
@27   = ~(Though slight of build, Haer'Dalis is strong and fast, his steps light and sure. There is an effortless grace to him, and at times it seems as if his feet barely touch the ground.)~
@28   = ~Why do you watch me so intently, my raven?~
@29   = ~Am I bothering you?~
@30   = ~I was wondering what you were thinking about.~
@31   = ~I just like looking at you.~
@32   = ~(Blush and avert your eyes.)~
@33   = ~Don't flatter yourself. I wasn't staring.~
@34   = ~Of course not. Stare as long as it pleases you.~
@35   = ~Aye, a bit. But this too shall pass.~
@36   = ~A question for a question, is it?~
@37   = ~Oh, too many things, and none of them good. I thank you for turning my thoughts to more pleasant matters.~
@38   = ~My mind was rather lost inside itself, but now it is afire with curious questions.~
@39   = ~You.~
@40   = ~Yes, this I can see.~
@41   = ~I cannot be certain if I like it, though. Perhaps you should continue for a while longer until I know my mind on the subject.~
@42   = ~This sparrow enjoys watching you as well, perhaps more than is reasonable.~
@43   = ~(Haer'Dalis chuckles to himself with an amused shake of his head.)~
@44   = ~(The bard says nothing, but when you glance his direction, he is frowing thoughtfully to himself.)~
@45   = ~You play coy rather well, my raven.~
@46   = ~I must have been mistaken.~
@47   = ~Ah, I see. If you wish, I could teach you to lie more convincingly, my raven.~
@48   = ~(Haer'Dalis shrugs and turns away, but a perpetual frown line seems to have made its residence between his brows.)~
@49   = ~(Haer'Dalis is holding one of his swords aloft at an angle, frowning at the nicks along the edge of the weapon. Of all his possessions, the twin blades are the only things he ever makes a fuss over.)~
@50   = ~(The tiefling catches your gaze and holds it for a long moment, his impossibly dark eyes revealing no hint of emotion. As he turns his gaze away from you, his brow furrows in deep thought.)~
@51   = ~(Haer'Dalis hums a slow, sorrowful tune under his breath. His faraway expression reflections the emotions of the melody.)~
@52   = ~What are you plotting that you glance my way so frequently? Perhaps it would be best if I do not ask, aye?~
@53   = ~(Haer'Dalis notices you watching him and tilts his head thoughtfully your direction, but says nothing.)~
@54   = ~(The tiefling languidly rolls his shoulders, letting out a tired sigh as his lean muscles bunch and shift.)~
@55   = ~I wonder if we hounds would be just as weary at the end of each day were we not burdened with the weight of our armor. Of course, then we would become known far and wide as 'the company who rushes onto the battlefield as naked as the day they were born!'~
@56   = ~Which could, perhaps, keep some of our enemies at bay. Shall we test that theory, my raven?~
@57   = ~(Though Haer'Dalis frequently calls himself 'sparrow,' in truth he more closely resembles a large cat. Neither overly tall nor muscular, the tiefling steps gracefully on silent feet, his dark eyes constantly prowling his surroundings, yet he maintains an air of careless calm in almost all situations.)~
@58   = ~(Your bard companion draws stares everywhere you go, though it is difficult to tell whether this is because of his silver tongue and charming smile, or because of his blue hair and striking facial markings.)~
@59   = ~(Either way, Haer'Dalis hardly seems to mind the attention.)~
@60   = ~'Tis intriguing that your spirit soars no matter what comes, my raven. The loss and recovery of your soul seems to have caused you no permanent harm.~
@61   = ~(Haer'Dalis offers an amused smile and a quick wink in reply.)~
@62   = ~(Haer'Dalis nods once and looks away.)~
@63   = ~What I would not give to crawl inside your mind at moments like this, my raven.~
@64   = ~(Haer'Dalis responds with a wide, pleased grin and a wondering shake of his head.)~
@65   = ~Chaos. You wear it well. Or perhaps it wears you?~
@66   = ~(The tiefling bows dramatically your direction.) This humble bard hangs upon your whim, my raven.~
@67   = ~(The bard tilts his head to one side and studies you thoughtfully for a long moment. Something akin to sadness lingers in his gaze before he turns away.)~
@68   = ~(Haer'Dalis seems lost in thought and does not acknowledge you.)~
@69   = ~(The tiefling smiles in return, but his eyes are dark and brooding. A frown returns quickly to his face, making it clear his thoughts are not on pleasant matters.)~
@70   = ~Ah, you are giving me that look, the one that I've taken to understand is both a reward and a punishment.~
@71   = ~(Your hand slides easily into his grasp, but he moves your hand to the bend of his elbow instead, pulling you close so that your hip brushes against his with every other step.)~
@72   = ~I know not what to make of you in moments like these.~
@73   = ~What do you mean?~
@74   = ~Just enjoy the moment.~
@75   = ~Good. Because I don't know what to make of you almost constantly.~
@76   = ~I'm sorry.~
@77   = ~I am certain you could figure out the answer yourself readily enough.~
@78   = ~Ah, using my own philosophy against me. Wise advice from a wise friend, indeed.~
@79   = ~Hah! I suppose we should rejoice in having this one thing in common then, aye?~
@80   = ~As am I.~
@81   = ~(The bard curls his fingers around yours, caressing your knuckles with his thumb. After a moment, he raises your hand to his lips for a lingering kiss, a dark fire of passion smoldering in his eyes.)~
@82   = ~If you only knew what your touch does to this poor, desperate sparrow...~
@83   = ~(At the touch of your hand, the bard stops and turns toward you, his eyes searching your face carefully. Whatever it is he sees there seems to reassure him, and he offers you a slight smile before twining his fingers with yours.)~
@84   = ~(Your fingers lace comfortably with his, and he offers you a soft but hesitant smile. You walk in comfortable companionship for several minutes before he gently releases your hand.)~
@85   = ~(You reach for the tiefling's hand, only to find that he's lengthened his stride. It is unclear if this is accidental, or if he is purposely avoiding your touch.)~
@86   = ~(Your hand slides easily into his grasp, but his grip goes lax after a moment. With a pained expression, the tiefling pulls away from your touch and busies himself with pretending to adjust his weapon belt.)~
@87   = ~(Haer'Dalis seems surprised to feel your fingers slide into his grasp, his dark eyes drinking in your expression as if he is hoping to find an answer to some unknown question written there.)~
@88   = ~(The bard appears to be wrapped up in his own thoughts and merely pats the back of your hand absently before wandering away.)~
@89   = ~(He glances down at your conjoined hands, then turns a sincere and thoughtful look toward you.)~
@90   = ~Thank you, my raven, for allowing this humble bard to participate in the grand play that is your life.~
@91   = ~(Haer'Dalis says nothing, but silently accepts your weight against him. His fingers lace together with yours, his thumb leaving warm trails across the back of your hand, and you feel a ghost of a kiss grace your temple.)~
@92   = ~Are you unwell? This humble bard believes you sleep far too little for your own good.~
@93   = ~Aye, I believe a good, long sleep is in order for the both of us, my raven. Death will surely catch us up in a blink should we drag ourselves onward for much farther.~
@94   = ~(Sighing, the bard rests against you as well, creating a balanced counterweight that allows the both of you a moment of reprieve, however brief it may be.)~
@95   = ~(He seems to misinterpret the approaching sway of your body as your way of asking for more personal space. He moves away just as you begin to tilt sideways, and you're forced to stagger inelegantly to catch yourself. Haer'Dalis doesn't seem to have noticed.)~
@96   = ~(How it happens, neither of you seem to know for certain, but through some twist of poor luck, you both end up sprawled on the ground. Rubbing his knee, the bard gives a pained shake of his head and helps you up.)~
@97   = ~Between the two of us, there seems to be a few too many left feet, aye?~
@98   = ~No, my raven, we mustn't...~
@99   = ~(The bard sighs, his expression pained, and brushes his fingertips across your cheek before turning away from you.)~
@100  = ~(Haer'Dalis casts you a regretful glance and shakes his head.)~
@101  = ~Let us not delay, my raven. Not now.~
@102  = ~Here, my tiny raven, this will be better for the both of us, methinks.~
@103  = ~(He sits down and indicates that you should sit behind him with your back against his. The two of you lean against each other for a peaceful moment.)~
@104  = ~Mayhap I should simply carry you, aye, little one?~
@105  = ~(Haer'Dalis tilts his head obligingly when your fingers brush aside his hair to peruse the assortment of gold and silver hoops adorning his right ear. He lets out a soft murmur as your fingers brush against his unusually hot skin, a curious playfulness in his sidelong glance before he pulls away and shakes his hair back into place.)~
@106  = ~(The tiefling is staring off vacantly into the middle distance when you innocently raise your hand to jingle his earrings. Haer'Dalis startles in a moment of uncharacteristic nervousness, catching one of the rings roughly on your outstretched fingers, and he recoils with a hiss of pain between his teeth.)~
@107  = ~Give fair warning when next you feel the need to abuse this poor sparrow, aye raven?~
@108  = ~(Your finger brushes delicately down the row of shining rings, a faint, musical chime reaching your ears as they bounce against each other. Haer'Dalis smiles at the sound.)~
@109  = ~And now you will think me less mad when I say I ever hear music in my head, my raven.~
@110  = ~(Haer'Dalis turns away when you reach for him, though it's difficult to say if he is ignoring you or if he simply did not notice you.)~
@111  = ~Oh! Easy, my hound. I believe that last battle nearly saw me less an ear, and 'tis still tender.~
@112  = ~Your affection is always desired, but not always wise. You may play with me another time, my raven, but let us focus on other things for the moment.~
@113  = ~If you are attempting to count them, let me know the number, aye? I do believe more than one have fallen victim to your enemies.~
@114  = ~Careful, my raven. Your frail Doomguard's ears are rather sensitive, and your touch is... alarmingly distracting.~
@115  = ~(Haer'Dalis preens a bit at your attention, and his eyes follow you long after you've moved away.)~
@116  = ~(The bard replies your advance with one of his own. His open palm hovers just above your skin as his thumb traces a long trail from the tip of your chin, along the line of your jaw, then finally up the curve of your ear. His fingers curl lightly in your hair before he winks slyly and pulls away.)~
@117  = ~(The tiefling's mane of silver-blue locks sifts between your fingers like spun silk, the hair lustrous and thick enough to make even a modest woman jealous. Something about the way he glances at you makes makes it clear that he is proudly aware of the envy he inspires.)~
@118  = ~(The bard sighs with dramatic sadness as you curl a strand of his hair around your finger.)~
@119  = ~'Twas once much darker, my raven, when this sparrow was young and foolish. It seems to become more silver by the year. Wisdom and reason tell me 'tis part of the natural decay of all life, but vanity insists otherwise.~
@120  = ~(Haer'Dalis makes a soft hum of pleasure as your fingers feather through his long locks, but the sound is cut short by a grimace of pain when you accidentally catch one of the decorative braids with a sharp tug.)~
@121  = ~The worst pain is the one we welcome willingly, aye?~
@122  = ~Think you this sparrow a kitten, waiting eagerly for you to stroke him at your whim?~
@123  = ~Enjoying this sparrow's plumage, are you? If it interests you so, keep an eye out for anything that might be nesting in there, aye? I would not be surprised, considering the places we often choose to rest our heads. Put your curiosity to good use, hmm?~
@124  = ~(You lift one of the beaded locks woven into the bard's hair, studying the intricate details of both the braid and the carved objects threaded into the hair.)~
@125  = ~They are reminders, my raven, of memories I never hope to forget. That particular memory has been with me for a number of decades, though my sister would cut off your hand for daring to touch it. Women are strange in that way, wouldn't you agree?~
@126  = ~(Haer'Dalis watches with interest while you weave a lock of his hair into a tiny braid. He regards you with open surprise, then a sudden contemplative tenderness softens his face briefly before he shakes off his bemusement and gestures for you to walk ahead of him.)~
@127  = ~Hmm? Was there something in my hair? No, no, answer this poor sparrow not. If 'twas so, I do not want to hear what it was.~
@128  = ~Mmm... If you but call for a rest, I would gladly lay my head in your lap and give you leave to do this for the rest of the <DAYNIGHT>.~
@129  = ~(The tiefling draws in a sharp breath as your fingertips thread through his hair, nails catching against his scalp. The gaze he turns upon you is heavy and thick with sudden, unexpected desire. He closes any distance between you in an instant, his hands now in your hair, cradling the back of your head and tilting your mouth to hover but a hairsbreadth from his parted lips.)~
@130  = ~(You can feel the indecision in his touch.)~
@131  = ~Temptress...~
@132  = ~(He releases you and turns sharply away.)~
@133  = ~I am well enough, my raven. Longing for The Cage at times, but worry not for this sparrow.~
@134  = ~Anxious, my raven, anxious for battle! 'Tis no shortage of violence in your fair presence, but this poor bard's appetites are oft insatiable.~
@135  = ~There is a stone in my boot, a buckle of my bracer has snapped clean in two, something in my pack is digging into my spine, and I have an insufferable tune spinning circles 'round my mind. All in all, I am as well as can be expected, raven.~
@136  = ~I fare well, though I find myself often distracted by a certain raven we both know.~
@137  = ~We are all of us scarred and worn and pieced back together, are we not?~
@138  = ~I fare well enough, my friend.~
@139  = ~Dead on my feet is what I be, my hound. Let us to rest, lest this tiefling make his bed on this very ground!~
@140  = ~Bruised and battered, but worse have I seen. I shall live to see another battle, have no doubt of that, my raven.~
@141  = ~My wounds pain my greatly, my relentless hound. If you wish to see me a grave man, let us press onward; if you wish for me to fight by your side for another day, I must seek healing immediately.~
@142  = ~Weary, worn and battle sore, my raven. Let us have rest! This actor cannot keep his mask in these circumstances, and I shall surely terrify you with my true face!~
@143  = ~Aye? A bit of rhyme I heard long ago has run circles 'round my mind this last hour. 'Tis one verse I devote to you, my raven.~
@144  = ~For one brief moment, let me see into your mind
Let me wander through your past to see what I might find
Let me dive into the darkest recesses of your heart
Help me understand you, down to your deepest part~
@145  = ~But will you, I wonder? Aye, I wonder indeed.~
@146  = ~For you, my raven.~
@147  = ~In her darkest hour
She refuses to cower
She screams to the night
'Not without a fight!'~
@148  = ~When all seems lost
And not worth the cost
She throws back her head
'I am not yet dead!'~
@149  = ~Shadows lurking behind
The night tempts her mind
She cries, wild and free
'You cannot have me!'~
@150  = ~In her worst nightmare
She will never show fear
But scream to the night
'Not without a fight!'~
@151  = ~Fate cruel and menacing
When nothing would stop us
You lashed your arrows to prey
Upon our own foolishness~
@152  = ~Insecurity tipped that so poisoned the mind
I lash out at you Fate and your bolts of despair
Sent with such venom to keep us apart
To deny us true love and the embrace we desired~
@153  = ~But you oh Love! Do not try and hide
You trickster you are not innocent in this
Blood is on your hands with your elusive techniques
To enrapture complete, then perform such torture~
@154  = ~As you dangle us, your victims upon the rack
Stretching us past the point of tolerance
I look upon lovers in the mist, specters all
In the tragedy of epic love abounding~
@155  = ~Cruel you two Vixens are
How I hate your very names
I would dash your heads upon the rocks
But in my misery I am weakened~
@156  = ~In my rapture I cannot see past her
I am powerless to defeat you here
Fate and Love who gave you the power
To perform such vindictive miracles~
@157  = ~The world was ours! Life was only a step away
With one kiss as the fairy tales portray
We would have succumbed to you Love
With one moment, our life would have paid you tribute~
@158  = ~But cruel Fate and elusive Love
You denied us our ransom and stole our fancy
Paralyzed our young minds with curare
Brought our false fears to bear with your shots~
@159  = ~How I hate you Fate! How you pain me Love!
I forsake you both! I challenge you to meet me
For battle awaits you, your doom awaits!
I shall shame you. Even to the shame of my house~
@160  = ~As I stand here with only shield in hand
String your vicious bows, aim them foolishly for my destruction
Launch your barbs, line your sights with my heart
But your poisons cannot touch what is not there~
@161  = ~For my heart is sent away from me
Freely given to roam the Stars above
I challenge you Fate! I decry you Love!
For I have found what you sought to deny~
@162  = ~Alas, this sparrow is of a different mind altogether at present. Perhaps another time, my raven.~
@163  = ~I recall a dark but lovely verse I once learned from a Prime. 'Twas a man scorned by love, or so he claimed. This sparrow saw him in the arms of a different lover every other night, so 'tis possible his sincerity was lacking.~
@164  = ~Oh Love, oh miserable Love
Who spurned you so?
To make your gifts seem so unattainable
Should they only be imagined in old tales
And the dreams of fairies in the fields?~
@165  = ~My diamond, so much like the sun
Life-giving, yet so far out of reach
May the internal fires of the sun
Burn through me and leave me not
A once burned shell, blessed with no beating heart~
@166  = ~Oh how glorious to be consumed by the sun
To have your flesh dyed red, for all to see!
Oh I miss you so when the rains come
My whole body aches for you once again
'When,' I cry, 'will you foul clouds run away!'~
@167  = ~How my mind laughs at the plight of us mortals
With one life to live, and one soul to give
All our days should be spent under the sunshine's rays
But quiver not again, the clouds will soon depart
As the day no longer lingers, bracing for deep nights~
@168  = ~Oh Love, oh miserable Love!
Who spurned you so?
To make our efforts seem for naught
No! I refuse your libations to defeat
I call forth my destiny, to one day be free~
@169  = ~It cannot be described
It can never be named
It is not confined
And never ashamed~
@170  = ~It can be beautiful
It can be terrible
It can be wonderful
Or completely unbearable~
@171  = ~Perfect it is not
And yet it is wise
It can never be bought
Or won as a prize~
@172  = ~It has more strength in one
Than a thousand men
It cannot be undone
Nor can it condemn~
@173  = ~I often wonder what these silly poets think as they build impossible expectations upon ephemeral emotion. Ah, but 'tis not this sparrow's place to judge the artist for their art, I suppose.~
@174  = ~I once found a scrap of parchment crumpled in the hand of a dead courtesan. Never you mind why this poor sparrow was searching her body to begin with, but scratched upon this paper were several sad verses that have lingered in my mind ever since.~
@175  = ~No matter what I do
I can't seem to get ahead
When I think I'm moving forward
I find I'm falling back instead~
@176  = ~I struggle and I strive
To make things work out right
But when I look around me
My dreams are nowhere in sight~
@177  = ~I carry this exhaustion
Reaching to my very core
I'm trying to keep going
But my everything feels sore~
@178  = ~I keep fighting so hard
To keep my hope alive
I'm stricken with despair
As I struggle and I strive~
@179  = ~Alas that I am shackled by sure gravity
Drawn to the heavens, but held to earth
Down in the dust of this pale, dry crust
If only I could hold the stars at night
And be consumed by their infinite light~
@180  = ~Absorbed by the expanse of the spans of stars
Released into the eternal light of the sun
Never in my dreams would I have dared
To feel the piercing malaise of my heart
I feared the stars when I was young, but never will I again~
@181  = ~(The bard catches your hands and raises each of them to his lips one at a time, his nearly black eyes sparkling as if in amusement, but his expression is solemn as he watches your face.)~
@182  = ~Your sun will set and yet will rise again
In between the moon's gentle changing phases
Like your heart's steady, gentle rhythm
Rides upon my breast like a golden locket
I have come to believe in your destiny
To ride upon the waves of your embrace 
Sailing to nowhere and everywhere at once~
@183  = ~To hold you against me closely
Your flesh intertwined with mine
Oh how my heart cries out for more
As I wait upon desires and my dreams
To be with you in each fragile living moment
Or hear your voice whispering upon my ears
And holding your hands, feeling each heart beat
As our passion collides and bursts forth anew~
@184  = ~(Haer'Dalis gives you a heavy, lingering gaze that starts at your feet and caresses its way up your body to eventually stop at your eyes.) Though short has been my stay on the Prime thus far, I begin to appreciate its scenes and scenery more with each passing day.~
@185  = ~The rain comes oh so sudden on this scene
So softly falling, lightly glazing
The green, green grass of spring
As the water pools in mountains soon be spilling
Building, building, gathering such speed
Flowing, flowing as the river always rushing
But slowly down the walls does the water fall
The raindrops plunge and merge together 
With the clear blue waters
As the river flows, flows, flows~
@186  = ~The river slowly graceful 
Holding tightly to the canyon walls
Feeling 'round each bend and curve
Touching every rock and crevice
Caressing every rock and crevice
Merging swiftly merging
Eroding slowly along the canyon
It continues building, building
The water swiftly meeting, greeting
As the river flows, flows, flows~
@187  = ~The river quickly shifting, 
Ever flowing, rougher going
As the rapids do approach
The water dashes, splashes, dashes,
With fierce white foam, its interactions
Grasping, grasping every rock and crevice
The tension escapes, as water imparts
Harmoniously overtaking the limits of the canyon wall
Rushing, rushing, splashing at the canyon walls,
As the river flows, flows, flows~
@188  = ~Then the rapids ending, ending 
Calmly slowing with smooth trails upon the river
The water silky, now so silky, rubbing
Along the canyon walls, slowly
Ever slowly, the water gently caressing
Along every rock and crevice
Lightly scratching every rock and crevice
As it slowly marches toward the deep
The river flowing, flowing out to now calm seas
But the river will be always flowing, ever flowing~
@189  = ~Aye, my raven? Ah, do my marks bother you?~
@190  = ~No, I just find them curious. They look like scars.~
@191  = ~On the contrary, I find them quite alluring.~
@192  = ~They're so strange.~
@193  = ~My father, tortured man that he was, flew into a rage one night and took his fury out on my young face with a carving knife. I can still hear my sister's screams, feel the hot blood pouring down my neck as I struggled...~
@194  = ~Hah! My raven, you should see your face. 'Twas nothing so traumatic, I assure you. I was born with these marks, perhaps a gift of my mother's heritage. They are no more painful than freckles, I imagine.~
@195  = ~(Your naked fingertips explore the intricate marks on the bard's face. They appear to be scars at first glance, the flesh smooth and glassy like poorly healed burns, but the symmetry and flawlessness of the lines suggests some other origin.)~
@196  = ~(After a moment of indulging your explorations, Haer'Dalis pulls away with an amused smile on his lips.)~
@197  = ~(The bard murmurs appreciatively under your attentions, tilting his head back to allow you to stroke the smooth lines adorned on his chin. With his eyes half-lidded and a sleepy smile on his lips, he looks much like a cat enjoying a good scratching.)~
@198  = ~Ah, uh, my raven, as much as I adore your attentions, 'tis quite difficult to watch for danger with your hands fluttering about my face so.~
@199  = ~(Haer'Dalis playfully bats your hands away from his face and eyes you in mock-suspicion.)~
@200  = ~(The tiefling pulls away when you reach for him, flashing you an inscrutable glance before he turns to hide his face from your sight.)~
@201  = ~(Haer'Dalis is frowning and appears lost in thought when you raise your hand to stroke his face. His reaction is a sharp intake of breath, a flinch and a lurching step away from you, leaving you standing with your hand hanging in the air while he stares at you with something very much like fear in his eyes.)~
@202  = ~(One blink of those dark pools and the emotion is gone, replaced by uncharacteristic embarrassment and the fainest hint of shame.)~
@203  = ~My imagination was run away with me, my raven. Forgive my ridiculous antics.~
@204  = ~(As you idly trace the patterns, Haer'Dalis raises his hand and trails his fingers across your cheeks and chin, drawing an imaginary mirror image of his markings on your flesh. His attention wavers and he stares in open wonderment at your bottom lip before physically shaking off his bemusement.)~
@205  = ~There will be time for such things later perhaps, my hound.~
@206  = ~(sigh) Must you poke and prod me like a slave at market?~
@207  = ~(The kiss begins innocently enough, just a simple brush of your lips against his, but you both lean in for more, over and over, deepening the contact with every kiss until your display borders on obscene. Breathing raggedly, Haer'Dalis pulls away and runs his fingers through his long hair, now tousled by your affection.)~
@208  = ~My raven, you are a burden upon my self-control. But I think you already knew that.~
@209  = ~Save your lips for another time, my raven.~
@210  = ~My dear raven, you taste like mystery and destiny. An addictive combination.~
@211  = ~Mmm... As delightful as this is, we must not linger overlong lest out enemies catch us unawares.~
@212  = ~(You lean in to give the tiefling a kiss on the cheek, but he turns his head suddenly to catch your mouth with his. A hum of pleasure rises in his throat as he pulls you into a fierce embrace, his tongue teasing your lips for only a moment before he pulls away. There is something reckless and almost dangerous about his dark stare.)~
@213  = ~(The bard cradles your face in his hands and kisses you lightly on your forehead, your cheeks, the tip of your nose, and finally, lingeringly on your lips. His smile is resigned but not unhappy as he folds your hand in his and gestures for you to walk with him.)~
@214  = ~Come, my lovely raven, let us off lest I forget why we are here to begin with.~
@215  = ~(Just as you turn to him, Haer'Dalis also turns toward you, catching both of your hands in his. Carefully, as if you are fragile or delicate, the bard raises each of your hands to his lips and lightly kisses your palms. Twining your fingers together, he pulls you close and ghosts a kiss against your forehead, his breath leading a warm trail down between your eyes and the length of your nose until his lips finally caress yours.)~
@216  = ~(When the moment ends, he says nothing as you draw apart, but you catch him smiling softly to himself from time to time.)~
@217  = ~(Haer'Dalis picks you fully up off the ground, his arms tucked securely around your waist, and kisses you lightly on your forehead, your cheeks, the tip of your nose, and finally, lingeringly on your lips. His smile is resigned but not unhappy as he settles you back on the ground, folds your hand in his and gestures for you to walk with him.)~
@218  = ~Come, my tiny raven, let us off lest I forget why we are here to begin with.~
@219  = ~(Though he is not a tall man by human standards, Haer'Dalis is tall enough compared to you that unannounced kisses are impossible when he's standing up. Fortunately, he is crouched on his haunches to adjust his pack, providing you a rare opportunity.)~
@220  = ~(His attention stays fixed on the task at hand as you approach, and a tiny upward twitch as the corner of his mouth is the only warning you get before he grabs your shoulders and uses his own body weight to rock backward, dragging you unceremoniously into his lap. Nimble fingers caress the back of your neck as he plunders your mouth with a quick, ravening kiss. His breath is hot and heavy against your lips when he releases you.)~
@221  = ~There are so many things I wish to do to you right now, my little tease, even here in the dirt for all eyes to see.~
@222  = ~Not to complain, but if you intend to seek my lips often, perhaps I should walk on my knees so I have no need to bend to your whim so frequently.~
@223  = ~(Haer'Dalis sighs, leaning into your embrace.)~
@224  = ~I am a creature who thrives off of complexities, off of confusion and argument and mystery, and yet the simplicity of being in your arms undoes me every time.~
@225  = ~Forgive me, my affectionate raven, but I do not wish to let my guard down. Later, you have my word.~
@226  = ~As pleasing as it is to be the object of your desires, I would much prefer we save such displays for times when we carry less leather and metal on our persons. 'Tis not nearly as erotic as some might think, aye?~
@227  = ~(Though his touch is brief and hesitant, Haer'Dalis spends a long moment gazing into your eyes after you part. It looks as though he is searching for something.)~
@228  = ~(The bard seems distracted and barely returns your embrace with more than minimal pressure. He forces a smile when you pull away, but it does not reach his eyes.)~
@229  = ~(The tiefling catches you around the waist and spins with you in his arms, sweeping you up in an amorous display of affection. He presses his lips against the side of your throat, murmuring something too quiet for you to hear, but the vibration of his mouth sends chills over your skin.)~
@230  = ~(He releases you after a moment with a roguish smile.)~
@231  = ~(The moment you reach for him, Haer'Dalis turns and takes a step closer to you, his shoulder colliding with yours and knocking you both off balance. You try to catch yourselves and each other at the same time, but only succeed in sending the tangled pair of you crashing to the ground with the tiefling squashed beneath you.)~
@232  = ~(He groans, the lets out a pained laugh, dark eyes sparkling even as he grimaces and tries to sort out the mess that is your limbs, armor, clothing and weapons.)~
@233  = ~If you wanted me on the ground this instant, all you had to do was ask, my hound. Save me the bruises, aye?~
@234  = ~(You start to wrap your arms around the tiefling's waist, but he grasps your hands and drops to his knees instead. Unbothered by the filthy ground beneath him, he places your arms around his neck before embracing you, his palms warm against the small of your back.)~
@235  = ~You are a powerful creature indeed, that you can bring this Doomguard to his knees for little more than the promise of your warm embrace.~
@236  = ~Mmm--oof!~
@237  = ~Oh, dear one, we shall have to carry about a stool for you to stand on for moments like this. Bending to your desires is a terrible burden on this poor sparrow's back!~
@238  = ~(The tiefling loops his arms around your waist and lifts you easily off the ground, sweeping you up in an amorous display of affection. He presses his lips against the side of your throat, murmuring something too quiet for you to hear, but the vibration of his mouth sends chills over your skin.)~
@239  = ~(He sets you gently onto the ground after a moment with a roguish smile.)~
@240  = ~(The tiefling graciously accepts your attentions by slipping his hand around the back of your neck to mirror your actions. For a long, lazy moment, the two of your do nothing more than enjoy the feel of one another.)~
@241  = ~You always offer the most delightful distractions to this humble sparrow. My thanks, dear raven.~
@242  = ~No, not here. Save your touch for another time.~
@243  = ~(The bard cringes and gingerly moves away from you.)~
@244  = ~I am grateful for your touch, my dear, but I fear my flesh is far too tender at present. When next I feel it wise to take a blow in your stead, do be kind enough to remind me of this moment, aye?~
@245  = ~(Haer'Dalis happens to turn suddenly just as you reach for him, and your hand catches him squarely in the throat. A choked sound escapes him, and though he recovers himself quickly enough, the look he casts you is equal parts exasperation and amusement.)~
@246  = ~Oh, you are temptation made flesh, fairest one, but let us save such intimacies for places that afford us greater privacy.~
@247  = ~(His chin drops hard against his chest as the tension drains from the line of his shoulders under your ministrations. Soft words of appreciation slip between his lips in whispered snippets, and when you withdraw, he gifts you with a contented smile.)~
@248  = ~(He chuckles softly and sweeps you up in a warm embrace.)~
@249  = ~Seeing you poised on the tips of your toes just so, straining to reach this sparrow's plumage... Ah, you are far too adorable and wonderful for your own good, darling <CHARNAME>.~
@250  = ~(The bard seems to read your mind and kneels before you just as you reach to touch him. He holds your gaze as you run your fingers over his heated skin, honest affection shining in the dark pools of his eyes. Taking your free hand in his, he lifts your palm to his lips and brushes faint, tickling kisses across your palm and the tips of your fingers.)~
@251  = ~A pity we cannot linger, my sweet <CHARNAME>. Thank you for this.~
@252  = ~(Haer'Dalis clearly did not notice your approach. Just as you reach up to touch him, he moves your direction, colliding rather painfully with you in a clatter of gear and weapons. His hand whips out to steady you, but the both of you stumble to your knees in a messy and painful tangle.)~
@253  = ~Ah... raven... we have to stop meeting like this, aye?~
@254  = ~My eyes have followed the sway of your hips all these long hours, and I find myself anxious to be alone with you. Indeed we should find some privacy, and soon, unless you wish to see this sparrow's control crumble to dust where all eyes can witness my desire for you.~
@255  = ~If you wish.~
@256  = ~Ah, I am ever at your disposal, lovely raven, no matter what your needs may be.~
@257  = ~(The tiefling closes the distance between you in a flash of dark eyes and silver-blue hair, lips descending on yours with biting intensity. His hands find your hips and tug you closer as he growls possessively into your mouth. He breaks the kiss only to pant two lust-filled words.)~
@258  = ~Why wait?~
@259  = ~Good point.~
@260  = ~(Kiss him again in sound agreement.)~
@261  = ~Ha-ha! Soon, my sparrow. Very soon...~
@262  = ~Oh, no. I'll keep you waiting. Adds to the passion.~
@263  = ~After *that* display?! I think not!~
@264  = ~Gah, you wicked tease. Such a strain you are upon my willpower!~
@265  = ~(sigh) Fickle creature...~
@266  = ~I admit, I would not be entirely against the idea...~
@267  = ~Some other time, perhaps.~
@268  = ~Sadly, I am not of a similar mind at present, but I am certain there is another at your disposal who would gladly fill whatever role you desire.~
@269  = ~Are you certain this humble sparrow is the one you desire?~
@270  = ~What does that mean?~
@271  = ~Of course!~
@272  = ~I wouldn't have approached you if I wanted someone else.~
@273  = ~Hmph, perhaps not.~
@274  = ~Correct me if I am mistaken, but you have made it clear that I am not the only lover in your life.~
@275  = ~You aren't the jealous type.~
@276  = ~That's true, but it's you I desire.~
@277  = ~What?! I have *not* taken another lover! Whatever gave you that idea?~
@278  = ~What can I say? It takes more than one lover to satisfy this Bhaalspawn.~
@279  = ~No, but I do not make a habit of being used either.~
@280  = ~For the moment.~
@281  = ~I... apologize, most sincerely. I do not know where the miscommunication originated, but I admit to feeling no small amount of relief at your words.~
@282  = ~I wonder, should I be satisfied to be but another fool in your future harem? Indeed I do wonder...~
@283  = ~I should thank the Lady for small favors then, hmm?~
@284  = ~Well, at least you answer honestly, my hound.~
@285  = ~Ah, am I to be the face that inspires your lust today? Aye, I suppose there are worse fates.~
@286  = ~Indeed? Well, I'd best tend to you soon lest your eye wander to other birds and leave this sparrow wanting.~
@287  = ~And glad I am to be with you as well, for as long as entropy allows. Or until you tire of my prattle, aye?~
@288  = ~Thank you, my friend.~
@289  = ~I never know how to take compliments from you, dear raven. If you wish something of me, you've no need for flattery. Simply ask.~
@290  = ~I am sure you find pleasure in the company of many, my hound.~
@291  = ~Ah, my dear raven, you only say this because I've ruined you for all other lovers.~
@292  = ~I enjoy our time together as well, my <CHARNAME>. And not simply because I've grown attached to the presence of your warm body in my bed.~
@293  = ~(You can feel the bard's concerned gaze follow you for the next several moments.)~
@294  = ~(The tiefling lets out a sigh of his own, though when you glance his direction, he seems to be lost in his own thoughts.)~
@295  = ~I know, dear raven. I know.~
@296  = ~Should we not stop for a rest? I think perhaps you drive yourself to exhaustion, my friend.~
@297  = ~(Haer'Dalis catches your hand and draws you close, lifting your wrist to his lips for a warm, lingering kiss as his dark eyes hold your gaze.)~
@298  = ~You've only but to ask, and I shall surely find ways to distract you from whatever meloncholy lingers in your thoughts, fair raven.~
@299  = ~Your sighs are far more pleasing when your lips are upon my ear and your body wound tightly with mine, my raven.~
@300  = ~'Twould be my pleasure, fairest raven.~
@301  = ~Do not torment me, my cruel hound.~
@302  = ~(His hesitation is obvious, and you watch a war of emotions flicker behind his eyes.)~
@303  = ~My raven... I am here for you. Whatever you need of me, I shall provide if I am able.~
@304  = ~(A warm, lingering kiss seems to be the only answer he is willing to provide.)~
@305  = ~My raven, at most times I am more than content to be used by you. But in this? No, I fear this I cannot do. Not even for you.~
@306  = ~My raven...~
@307  = ~(He shakes his head sadly, his eyes guarded.)~
@308  = ~That would be most unwise.~
@309  = ~And... you think your lover will not notice this new arrangement? Is he, perhaps, blind, deaf and dull-witted?~
@310  = ~I have little interest in being butchered in my sleep by your jealous lover, my hound. I shall have to decline.~
@311  = ~(The tiefling appears to be ignoring you.)~
@312  = ~Haer'Dalis, there's something in my pack that keeps poking me. Can you see what it is?~
@313  = ~I miss your touch, my love. We should make camp soon, don't you think?~
@314  = ~I miss your touch, dear love. We should make camp soon, don't you think?~
@315  = ~I'm so glad I found you, my sparrow.~
@316  = ~I love you, Haer'Dalis.~
@317  = ~My raven, my love! Why can you not take your eyes from this sparrow?~
@318  = ~Aye, a bit, but only because I feel your gaze upon me and confuse it with the weighty stares of our enemies. I believe that is a sign that we have far more enemies than we ought, aye?~
@319  = ~'Twould bother me far more if you never looked my way.~
@320  = ~Oh, too many things at once, and I am grateful for your timely intervention. Some things are meant to be forgotten.~
@321  = ~And I delight in your stares, dear one.~
@322  = ~(The bard says nothing, but when you glance his direction, he offers you a tender smile.)~
@323  = ~How is it possible that you are even lovelier when you play coy like this?~
@324  = ~You cannot deceive a deceiver, my darling love.~
@325  = ~(Haer'Dalis shrugs and turns away, but every time you look his direction thereafter, he meets your glance with a small, knowing smile.)~
@326  = ~(The tiefling catches your gaze and smiles, revealing himself to be in pleasant mood as he offers you his arm.)~
@327  = ~Come, beloved raven, walk with me but a few moments before chaos returns to our fair company once more.~
@328  = ~(Haer'Dalis taps the flat of his fingertips against his thighs as he walks, creating a thrumming, complex rhythm that you cannot seem to ignore even when you try to focus on something else. When he notices your attention, the tiefling's hands grow still and the pulsing rhythm vanishes. The bard says nothing, but he offers you a small, mysterious smile.)~
@329  = ~'Tis intriguing that your spirit soars no matter what comes, my raven. The loss and recovery of your soul seems to have caused you no permanent harm, and I am glad for that.~
@330  = ~Whatever are you plotting, my half-goddess muse?~
@331  = ~(The tiefling bows dramatically your direction.) I am utterly enthralled by your will, my dearest raven. Do with me what thou wilt!~
@332  = ~(The bard tilts his head to one side and studies you thoughtfully for a long moment. A slow, soft smile steals over the corners of his mouth, and he seems to have difficulty forcing himself to look away from you.)~
@333  = ~(The tiefling smiles in return, but his eyes are thoughtful and distant. A frown returns quickly to his face, making it clear his thoughts are elsewhere.)~
@334  = ~What makes you smile, I wonder? Is it death stalking your footsteps that makes you grin? Doth entropy bring you the joy I see in your eyes? Do you revel in the destruction you've wrought? Are your dreams filled with gleeful accounts of chaos and madness?~
@335  = ~Or perhaps you were merely being friendly? I am uncertain which answer I prefer.~
@336  = ~(Your hand slides easily into his grasp, drawing a soft hum of approval from the smiling tiefling. The pair of you proceed hand-in-hand for some distance.)~
@337  = ~How is it that you know exactly when I am in need of your touch, my raven?~
@338  = ~Magic.~
@339  = ~I was in need of your touch, too.~
@340  = ~Well, I do know you rather well by now, my love.~
@341  = ~Don't try to make something more out of it. I just wanted to touch you.~
@342  = ~(The bard laughs and brushes a kiss across your cheek.)~
@343  = ~Ah, we are very similar creatures, methinks.~
@344  = ~That you do, and I am most glad for it. Well, most of the time. On occasion, your uncanny knack for deciphering this bard's innermost workings is indeed disconcerting...~
@345  = ~Then I shall accept what you offer without complaint.~
@346  = ~You wish me to fight one-handed? Aye, 'tis a challenge I accept, my raven!~
@347  = ~(Your fingers lace comfortably with his, and he offers you a warm and open smile. You walk in comfortable companionship for several minutes while the bard hums a happy tune under his breath.)~
@348  = ~(You reach for the tiefling's hand, only to find he has reached for yours at the same time. The surprise in his expression shifts quickly to playful mischief as he catches your waiting hand and expertly sweeps you in an impromptu dance.)~
@349  = ~(It only lasts a few steps before he laughingly pulls you into a tangled embrace and presses his lips against the side of your neck. His warm breath ghosts against your skins as he releases a contented sigh.)~
@350  = ~Ah, my dear <CHARNAME>, you read my mind at times. I was just musing what it would feel like to hold chaos and destiny in my hands. I thank you for reminding me.~
@351  = ~(One minute you're enjoying the weight of his hand curled around your fingers, and the next you feel yourself spun into a tight embrace. Haer'Dalis dips you backward, weapons, gear and all, and brushes a warm but faint kiss across your lips. With his eyes half lidded and his silver-blue hair falling about your face in tickling waves, he smiles as he drinks in your expression.)~
@352  = ~'Tis no simple matter to catch the child of a god unawares. Glad I am to have managed such a feat and lived to tell about it.~
@353  = ~(Just as you swing your hand toward him, Haer'Dalis turns your direction. Instead of grasping his fingers, you end up smacking him rather firmly between his legs with the back of your hand.)~
@354  = ~(The tiefling's eyebrows shoot upward, then his mouth twists into a wide grin of amusement.)~
@355  = ~Ah, I should not laugh and encourage you, for had I been dressed for less than battle, you'd have done me a fine injury with that wayward hand. Do be more careful, dear raven, aye?~
@356  = ~(Haer'Dalis says nothing, but silently accepts your weight against him. Occasionally his fingers trace along the edge of your arm in an absent gesture.)~
@357  = ~No, wait...~
@358  = ~(The tiefling turns you gently toward him and pulls you into a full embrace. He sighs against your hair and his hands tighten against your back.)~
@359  = ~This... this I prefer, dear raven.~
@360  = ~(Haer'Dalis just happens to twist and shift at exactly the wrong moment. It's too late to catch yourself any other way, and you're forced to grab a double handful of the bard's rear to save your nose from being smashed painfully against his back.)~
@361  = ~(Though he startles in surprise at the sudden invasion of his personal space, the Doomguard is soon laughing merrily as he pieces together what has led to your spontaneous groping. His dark eyes sparkle with teasing amusement.)~
@362  = ~All you had to do was ask, dearest raven.~
@363  = ~You look weary, my love. This humble bard believes you sleep far too little for your own good. Perhaps that is partly my fault, aye?~
@364  = ~(The tiefling turns you gently toward him and pulls you against his chest. He sighs into your hair and lets his hands knead up and down your back in a slow, sensual embrace.)~
@365  = ~Your arms are a comfort to me. I admit, I am a bit mystified how that came to be.~
@366  = ~(He sits down and abruptly pulls you into his lap, curling himself around your smaller body for one peaceful moment of rest.)~
@367  = ~All you had to do was ask, raven of my heart.~
@368  = ~(Though he begins hunting for the source of your discomfort with impassive professionalism, the bard's voice is decidedly teasing when he begins to muse aloud.)~
@369  = ~Surely you realize how you torment me in these moments. I have spent many a night longing to run my hands just so...~
@370  = ~(sigh) I cannot believe these words will pass through my lips, but your pack is an even worse disaster than my own!~
@371  = ~Hmm... I see nothing, <CHARNAME>. Mayhap this mystery pain is trapped beneath your garments? I would gladly check there as well, if you would but invite me to do so.~
@372  = ~Let us take a look a--~
@373  = ~Ah. Ahem. My raven. Do *not* move.~
@374  = ~(Out of the corner of your eye, you see the bard draw one of his swords and turn the point toward your left shoulder.)~
@375  = ~(Remain still.)~
@376  = ~What in the Nine Hells are you doing?!~
@377  = ~(Lurch away from his blade.)~
@378  = ~(Everything is very still and silent for a heartbeat, then you feel the pressure of the tip of his blade against your back and hear a sickening crunch before the weight pulls away.)~
@379  = ~(The bard looses an explosive sigh and tilts the sword for you to see. Impaled upon the point is a beetle the size of your hand, its thick, spiked legs flailing helplessly as it works its dangerous pincers in a vain attempt to free itself.)~
@380  = ~You made a friend, <CHARNAME>.~
@381  = ~Trust me.~
@382  = ~No! Wait!~
@383  = ~(Something claws on needle-like feet up your neck and has almost burrowed its way into your hair before you manage to dislodge it. A beetle the size of your hand scrambles away on spiked legs, leaving you staring after your unwanted passenger.)~
@384  = ~Hmph. You should have trusted me, my hound.~
@385  = ~(He whistles to himself as he searches under your pack, then the bard suddenly goes very silent and still. A heartbeat later, you feel a tug against your pack, and the tiefling moves into your sight, his face somber as he regards the splintered arrow he has pulled free.)~
@386  = ~My raven... You ought not turn your back to archers in the future, aye?~
@387  = ~What a curious coincidence, for I too feel something sharp attempting to dig a hole in my spine. Come, let us sit together a moment and sort out our collection of trinkets and rubbish.~
@388  = ~(The bard hums thoughtfully as he fishes around in the space between your spine and your pack. His fingers playfully poke your ribs from time to time, searching for a reaction, but after a moment he withdraws a small twig and tosses it aside.)~
@389  = ~'Twas naught but some jealous tree's attempt to bring you pain. Shall we return to the road?~
@390  = ~Forgive me, my raven, but I think you are more than capable of handling the matter yourself, aye?~
@391  = ~Why do I suspect you desire little more than to bring me to my knees on your whim, tiny raven? If 'tis truly a bother, I suggest you remove your pack and conduct your own search.~
@392  = ~(Haer'Dalis crouches down behind you to ease the weight of your pack to the ground. He slides one palm down your back, checking for the source of your discomfort, then begins to examine your pack. After a moment, he sighs and shrugs.)~
@393  = ~I can find nothing, little one. Mayhap it shifted when the pack dropped?~
@394  = ~If you long for my hands upon your skin, my beloved <CHARNAME>, all you need do is say so. Games are unnecessary.~
@395  = ~Hmm... I see nothing, <CHARNAME>. Mayhap this mystery pain is trapped beneath your garments? Perhaps I ought strip away this hindrances and give a thorough inspection of your person... for the sake of your comfort, of course.~
@396  = ~Whatever would you do without me here to search you for pests, <CHARNAME>?~
@397  = ~Hmph. I thought trust was well established between us, but I see I was wrong, my hound.~
@398  = ~My raven... I will guard your back, but you must be more careful.~
@399  = ~(The bard hums thoughtfully as he fishes around in the space between your spine and your pack. His fingers stroke and linger along your ribs and low across your back, his breath warm and constant against your neck as he stands closer than is strictly necessary for the task. Eventually he withdraws a small twig and tosses it aside.)~
@400  = ~'Twas naught but some jealous tree's attempt to bring you pain. Should I perhaps continue my search, in case there are more villains lingering?~
@401  = ~(Haer'Dalis eagerly complies with your request - by embracing you from the front, his arms beneath yours to pull you snugly against the hard planes of his body. His hands slide beneath your pack, supposedly searching for the source of your discomfort, but with his open mouth pressed to your neck, whispering soft nonsense against your sensitive flesh, it's difficult to say if any progress is being made.)~
@402  = ~I can find nothing, little one, and I suspect you knew I would find exactly that. Mayhap a kiss is in order to encourage your poor bard to trust you once again?~
@403  = ~(Haer'Dalis tilts his head obligingly when your fingers brush aside his hair to peruse the assortment of gold and silver hoops adorning his right ear. He lets out a soft murmur as your fingers move against his unusually hot skin, a curious playfulness in his sidelong glance before he pulls away and shakes his hair back into place.)~
@404  = ~Do you like my decorations, my raven?~
@405  = ~I do. They suit you.~
@406  = ~I wish I had some pretty hoops like that for my ears.~
@407  = ~They're a bit impractical.~
@408  = ~There's too many of them. They look silly.~
@409  = ~I've always hated earrings.~
@410  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@411  = ~Aye, they would suit you well.~
@412  = ~I cannot argue with that. I once had a cambion grab hold of them and tear the whole lot straight out of my ears! I was most grateful for healing magic that day, I can assure you.~
@413  = ~Oh, but a male must adorn himself with more shiny baubles than the next male if he wishes to attract the attentions of lovely females. Even the simplest of birds knows this, my raven.~
@414  = ~'Tis a good thing you have little need for them then, aye?~
@415  = ~(You can feel the tension and longing in his touch.)~
@416  = ~My love...~
@417  = ~(His kiss hardly more than a fleeting, featherlight caress, then he releases you and turns sharply away.)~
@418  = ~I am with you, my love. How could I be anything less than enraptured?~
@419  = ~Hmm... Why *is* a raven like a writing desk...? Could it be that... Oh, apologies my dear raven, but my mind is lost within itself. Let us speak some other time.~
@420  = ~I worry for you at times, my darling <CHARNAME>, but it pleases me to be at your side through these trials.~
@421  = ~(Haer'Dalis catches your hands before they reach his face, pausing to kiss the second knuckle on each of your fingers before offering you a wink and turning away.)~
@422  = ~(The tiefling pulls away when you reach for him, flashing you an exasperated glance that he likely reserves for irritating young children in his audiences.)~
@423  = ~(One blink of those dark pools, and the emotion is gone, replaced by awkward amusement and a sheepish laugh.)~
@424  = ~(As you idly trace the patterns, Haer'Dalis raises his hand and trails his fingers across your cheeks and chin, drawing an imaginary mirror image of his markings on your flesh. His smile is warm and perhaps a little wistful.)~
@425  = ~Ah, my raven, that tickles!~
@426  = ~My raven, my love, this desire you ignite within my heart frightens me at times. But I have no wish to be without it even for a moment.~
@427  = ~Save your lips for another time, my dear, and hope we have ample opportunities to make use of them.~
@428  = ~(You lean in to give the tiefling a kiss on the cheek, but he turns his head suddenly to catch your mouth with his. A hum of pleasure rises in his throat as he pulls you into a fierce embrace, his tongue teasing your lips for only a moment before he pulls away. For a fleeting moment, there is an unusual vulnerability behind the desire in your lover's eyes.)~
@429  = ~(The bard cradles your face in his hands and kisses you lightly on your forehead, your cheeks, the tip of your nose, and finally, lingeringly on your lips. His smile is wide and filled with fondness as he folds your hand in his and gestures for you to walk with him.)~
@430  = ~Come, my love, let us off lest I forget why we are here to begin with.~
@431  = ~(When the moment ends, he says nothing as you draw apart, but you catch him watching you from time to time, a soft smile constantly in place on his lips.)~
@432  = ~(Haer'Dalis picks you fully up off the ground, his arms tucked securely around your waist, and kisses you lightly on your forehead, your cheeks, the tip of your nose, and finally, lingeringly on your lips. His smile is wide and filled with fondness as he settles you back on the ground, folds your hand in his and gestures for you to walk with him.)~
@433  = ~Come, my tiny beloved, let us off lest I forget why we are here to begin with.~
@434  = ~Not to complain, but if you intend to seek my lips often, perhaps I should walk on my knees so I have no need to bend to your whim so often.~
@435  = ~Forgive me, my affectionate darling, but I do not wish to let my guard down. Later, you have my word.~
@436  = ~Are you certain your mother was not a succubus? I have known many in my life, but none have made me lose focus the way you do.~
@437  = ~(The bard seems distracted and barely returns your embrace with more than minimal pressure. He smiles when you pull away and assures you that nothing is wrong, but he seems distant and thoughtful for quite a while longer.)~
@438  = ~(He releases you after a moment with a sweet, lingering kiss on your lips.)~
@439  = ~(He sets you gently onto the ground after a moment with a sweet, lingering kiss on your lips.)~
@440  = ~(The bard's rumbling groan of appreciation is surely lascivious enough to draw stares, but he seems far too busy enjoying the feel of your hand on his skin to care what anyone else - including you - might think of him.)~
@441  = ~I am grateful for your touch, my love, but I fear my flesh is far too tender at present. When next I feel it wise to take a blow in your stead, do be kind enough to remind me of this moment, aye?~
@442  = ~Oh? I cannot help but wonder how you would react if I declined, my love. Perhaps you shall have to offer me some persuasion when our time on the road is concluded for today, aye?~
@443  = ~Ah, I am ever at your disposal, my love, no matter what your needs may be.~
@444  = ~(The tiefling closes the distance between you in a flash of dark eyes and silver-blue hair, lips descending on yours with biting intensity. His hands find your hips and tug you closer as he growls possessively into your mouth. He breaks the kiss only to breathe two lust-filled words.)~
@445  = ~Aye, and aye again, my beloved!~
@446  = ~Ah, as tempting as you are, this poor frail bard needs his beauty sleep. Between the battles and the long walks and your amorous overtures, 'tis a wonder this sparrow has the power to walk upright!~
@447  = ~If I decline, I wonder if you would seek another to fill the role in my stead...~
@448  = ~No, but I do not make a habit of being used either. Doubly so when my heart is involved.~
@449  = ~I... apologize, most sincerely. I do not know where the miscommunication originated, but I admit to feeling no small amount of relief at your words, my love.~
@450  = ~Should I be satisfied to be but another fool in your future harem? No, I do not think that would suit this sparrow in the least.~
@451  = ~I am glad you found me as well, else I'd still be counting rice in the sewers! Hah, but do not look at me so! 'Tis not the only reason I adore your company, my love. Until entropy parts us, I am yours completely.~
@452  = ~My beloved raven... (sigh) I cannot find words to express how much you mean to me. Glad I am to have found you as well.~
@453  = ~You find pleasure in the company of many, my hound. Why should mine be any different?~
@454  = ~I enjoy our time together as well, my darling <CHARNAME>. And not simply because I've grown attached to the presence of your warm body in my bed.~
@455  = ~(The bard moves to your side, his head tilted to examine your face carefully.)~
@456  = ~Are you unwell, my raven?~
@457  = ~(sigh again)~
@458  = ~Everything's just such a mess!~
@459  = ~(Let him see the tears in your eyes.)~
@460  = ~I don't know, Haer'Dalis. I just don't know.~
@461  = ~No, I'll be fine. Don't worry.~
@462  = ~Actually, I feel rather content.~
@463  = ~Just leave me alone, bard.~
@464  = ~Oh, my raven. Surely not all is ill? I can only hope you will grace me with your lovely smile when next you look my way.~
@465  = ~(He kisses your cheek and smiles.)~
@466  = ~All will be as it should, my love.~
@467  = ~Do not worry yourself overmuch, dearest raven. 'Tis true that this life is not always easy to bear, but I would not have you give up just yet.~
@468  = ~(His arms fold you against his chest and he presses a soft kiss against your temple, wordlessly offering you comfort for as long as you need.)~
@469  = ~(His lips find yours in a hard, wild kiss that has him growling into your mouth and clutching at your hips. Despite how it must look to anyone watching, this kiss feels far more like an affirmation than a sexual advance. The way he holds you exudes comfort and strength, and each breathless murmur between kisses seems to say, 'I am here, we are alive, *be* alive.'~
@470  = ~(When the moment finally ends, he cannot seem to meet your eyes, but you can feel his hands tremble against your back as he continues to hold you.)~
@471  = ~Whatever you need from me, you've only to ask, my darling raven. If you need me to haul your pack, I shall. If you need me to clean your gear, consider it done. If you need me to make love to you until your eyes are filled with stars and you can no longer feel your limbs... well, then you should probably ask me to do that first.~
@472  = ~(His expression falls and he catches you up in a fierce embrace, as if he is afraid you will fall to pieces and he means to literally hold you together.)~
@473  = ~I beg you, my love, do not look at me so. I would rather face torment behind bars of steel than see you in such pain.~
@474  = ~(With a sigh, Haer'Dalis steps close to you. Very carefully, he raises his hands to your face and wipes away your tears, then presses a feather-light kiss against each of your closed eyelids.)~
@475  = ~(The expression on his face makes his reluctance perfectly clear, but he only nods and moves away.)~
@476  = ~(He smiles and gives a wry shake of his head.)~
@477  = ~Merely content? Such a pity, dear raven.~
@478  = ~'Tis a far sight better than misery, and so I am glad.~
@479  = ~Ah, then I shall have to do my utmost to turn your contentment to restless abandon when next we have a moment alone, aye?~
@480  = ~Aye, as my hound commands.~
@481  = ~(sigh) I sense I will sleep alone tonight once again...~
@482  = ~(Haer'Dalis says nothing, but moves to walk closer to you, perhaps hoping to offer you the reassurance of his presence.)~
@483  = ~Say you will soon stop for a rest, my love, before you drive yourself to exhaustion.~
@484  = ~(The bard curls his arm around you and draws you close so that his mouth is pressed against your ear.)~
@485  = ~Were we alone right now, I would gladly put my tongue to better use and draw out far more satisfying sounds from your sweet lips, my love. How I wish to drown out your misery with pleasure and see your eyes shine with want for your sparrow...~
@486  = ~(Haer'Dalis catches your mouth with his in a heated, open-mouthed caress of soft lips and teasing tongue. When he finally breaks away to allow you to breathe, he continues to hold you close and rests his forehead against yours.)~
@487  = ~Sigh and sigh again if you must, my dearest one, but know that my lips wait to catch each sound of sorrow and turn them to tones of passion.~
@488  = ~(The adoring smile he offers you wordlessly echoes your sentiment.)~
@489  = ~Oh? At times I wonder if you use your sweetest words to manipulate this poor sparrow. But of course you know I love you as well, aye?~
@490  = ~And I you, my beloved muse.~
@491  = ~Aye, and I love you as well, in ways so much deeper than these bits of flesh and moments of passion we share.~
@492  = ~(Without meeting your eyes, Haer'Dalis catches one of your hands and raises your palm to his lips.)~
@493  = ~I love the touch of your fingers upon my skin.~
@494  = ~(He tugs your hand to pull you close and places your arms around his waist.)~
@495  = ~I love the sensation of your arms around me, and I love the way we fit together like pieces of some intimate puzzle.~
@496  = ~(His hands slide upward from your elbows and across your shoulders to clasp you to him in a tender embrace.)~
@497  = ~I love how remarkably strong you are, strong enough to bear up under the weight of the world it seems, strong enough to love this fool of a Doomguard.~
@498  = ~(He nuzzles his face against the crux of your neck, his lips warm and softly humming.)~
@499  = ~I love the way you feel against me, the way you taste, the way you smell...~
@500  = ~(He shifts to take your face in both hands and drinks in your expression from dark eyes filled with longing and adoration as his thumbs idly trace the slope of your cheek and the bottom curve of your lips.)~
@501  = ~My raven, my <CHARNAME>, my muse, I worship every part of you, but I love nothing more than seeing my sentiments reflected in your eyes when you look upon me. 'Tis the one thing I selfishly and foolishly hope I never live to see fade away.~
@502  = ~Despite how your heart wanders, my hound, truly you do hold mine in your hands.~
@503  = ~Your love is a fickle, cruel thing at times, methinks, but alas that I cannot help but love you in return, it seems.~
@504  = ~And how many others besides, I wonder...~
@505  = ~I am at your command, my dearest love, regardless of the battlefield.~
@506  = ~(He moves in very close to you, but does not touch you. His eyes burn with naked longing.)~
@507  = ~If that is your desire, know that you will not wake rested the next day should I have anything to say about it.~
@508  = ~My raven, at most times I am more than content to be used by you. But in this? I... Forgive me, but no.~
@509  = ~And... you think your lover is blind, deaf, and dull-witted enough not to notice this new arrangement?~
@510  = ~But of course, my raven. What do you wish to know?~
@511  = ~I was wondering if there were any parts in particular you think I should read.~
@512  = ~In these sections you recommended, not all of these things happened the way you describe them.~
@513  = ~Haer'Dalis, some of these supposed 'intimate moments' you wrote about are outright lies!~
@514  = ~Where did you get this drawing of me?~
@515  = ~I found all these leaves tucked between the pages.~
@516  = ~I found this rather interesting drawing of you... and a dragon...~
@517  = ~This flower was pressed between two pages.~
@518  = ~According to this note I found, it was your birthday recently.~
@519  = ~Haer'Dalis, this note... it says you *left*...~
@520  = ~Where did you find this sketch of Candlekeep?~
@521  = ~Is this a lock of your hair? I found it inside the book.~
@522  = ~When I was flipping through the pages, this key fell out.~
@523  = ~This scrap of cloth was inside. It has a funny symbol on it.~
@524  = ~I found this theater ticket from back in Amn.~
@525  = ~Never mind. It's nothing.~
@526  = ~Indeed. Allow the sparrow to mark a few of his favorite passages for the dear raven.~
@527  = ~Some have been embellished, 'tis true, but only the smallest details. The core of your tale, its heart and soul, these things I did not dare tamper with. Worry not, my love. You and I know the the truth of things.~
@528  = ~I know. Call it poetic license, my dear. Or wishful thinking, perhaps.~
@529  = ~Why, I drew it, of course. In repose, you bear little resemblance to the strong, capable woman who stands now before me. You are softer, more innocent, younger, if you will forgive me saying so. The juxtaposition is startling and fascinating. I found myself unable to resist the desire to capture you in that moment.~
@530  = ~Ah, so that is where I put them! I... my raven? You did not perchance touch them with your bare hands, did you? Ah. Yes. Well, perhaps we ought to get you to a healer, aye? Just in case. Although, you *are* still breathing, so I suppose that's a good sign...~
@531  = ~Oh? Ah. Yes, well. Why don't I just take that and burn it and we'll never speak of this again, aye?~
@532  = ~'Tis no longer a flower, but a memory of a flower, a hint of beauty captured in death.~
@533  = ~This foolish bard could not bear to allow it to turn to dust so quickly.~
@534  = ~Aye, and I am another year older. Strange. Even in the presumed immortality of my youth, I never imagined that I would live to see so many years pass me by. At times I wonder if entropy mocks me intentionally with such irony, denying me satisfaction despite my devotion to its ways.~
@535  = ~It also says I came back, my love.~
@536  = ~'Tis pleasing to know it is accurate enough for you to easily recognize. Though I have never seen the place with mine eyes, I have done a fair amount of research into your former home. That ought not surprise you, my love.~
@537  = ~Oh. It likely seems strange to find such an object tucked away in a book, I suppose. It... it's a Planar thing, my dear. You wouldn't understand.~
@538  = ~Wonderful! I have searched for this key for weeks! And... now? Now I cannot recall what it opens. (sigh) How fitting.~
@539  = ~That, my raven, is the symbol of the Doomguard. Saalyn gave it to me, her idea of a joke. Some fool berk started a fight with her, and after she drowned him in his own blood, it was discovered that he was a Doomguard like myself. She cut that patch off his sleeve and gifted it to me, saying, 'I do so enjoy meeting your friends, Brother.' She laughed about it for days. Barmy woman, my sister.~
@540  = ~Aye, 'tis a fond remembrance, that one. It reminds me of how I met you, and on rare occasion, I muse where I might be had none of those events come to pass.~
@541  = ~Of course, my raven. What do you wish of me?~
@542  = ~Have you ever thought about having children?~
@543  = ~I could ask you the same thing. You keep looking at me like you have something on your mind.~
@544  = ~Do you want to talk about what happened at the temple with your sister?~
@545  = ~Are you ever going to search for Saalyn?~
@546  = ~This Melissan woman - what do you think of her?~
@547  = ~When was the first time you killed someone?~
@548  = ~Tell me, what do you think of Sarevok?~
@549  = ~Tests, tests and more tests! What is the point of all this?~
@550  = ~How many more of my siblings must I kill?~
@551  = ~Never mind. We can talk another time.~
@552  = ~As you wish.~
@553  = ~What makes you assume I don't already have children?~
@554  = ~What?!~
@555  = ~You know, that's a good question.~
@556  = ~You would have told me if you did.~
@557  = ~(Laugh hysterically.)~
@558  = ~That's the sort of thing you might want to mention to the woman you're in love with!~
@559  = ~That's the sort of thing you might want to mention to the woman you're sleeping with!~
@560  = ~That's the sort of thing you might want to mention before now!~
@561  = ~You better be kidding.~
@562  = ~Are you so certain of that?~
@563  = ~Ah... Careful, my cackling hound. You'll break a rib if you keep that up.~
@564  = ~Why does it matter? Would it truly change anything between us?~
@565  = ~Perhaps you forget that I have seen nearly nine decades of life, my raven. I could believably have children twice or thrice your age, and a whole herd of grandchildren besides.~
@566  = ~Do you?~
@567  = ~I'm certain you would have told me.~
@568  = ~When you put it that way, our relationship seems a little... odd.~
@569  = ~Oh, *gross*!~
@570  = ~Great. Now you're telling me that I'm some sort of step-great-great-grandmother to a bunch of little fiendlings.~
@571  = ~I'm having a hard time imagining that.~
@572  = ~Why wouldn't you tell me something like this before now?!~
@573  = ~Of course not.~
@574  = ~Ah, but you do know me well, my raven. I do not have any miniatures of myself running amok.~
@575  = ~Because of the age disparity? 'Tis slight compared to some. But in case you are wondering still, indeed I do not have any children.~
@576  = ~Hah, this expression you wear is wondrous! But let me put your mind to rest. I do not have any miniatures of myself - or miniatures of my miniature selves - running loose in the multiverse.~
@577  = ~Mayhap because it is not true, my assuming hound.~
@578  = ~Or to be rather more accurate, I do not have any children as far as I know.~
@579  = ~There's a chance you have children you don't even know about?~
@580  = ~I see.~
@581  = ~How nice for you and your dangly bits that you can just walk away from the inconvenience of pregnancy.~
@582  = ~Well, for your sake, I hope the little bastards stay missing.~
@583  = ~Smart of you to not let yourself get tied down.~
@584  = ~I am under no vow of chastity, my raven.~
@585  = ~As you are well aware, I am under no vow of chastity, my dear raven.~
@586  = ~I am a man of constant movement and change. If I have left a fatherless child in my wake, then I do truly regret that, but I see little I can do to change what has passed me by.~
@587  = ~Do not insult me, hound. I would not abandon a woman who carried my child, nor would I flee the burden of such responsibility.~
@588  = ~I'm sorry. I didn't mean to insult you.~
@589  = ~You're saying you'd settle down if you got a woman pregnant?~
@590  = ~That seems highly contrary to all of your wandering, planewalking, Doomguard ways.~
@591  = ~Don't insult *me* by expecting me to believe you know anything about responsibility!~
@592  = ~Oh, the lies we tell ourselves...~
@593  = ~Very well.~
@594  = ~Let there be no misunderstanding. A planewalker and traveling bard I am, and so shall I ever be 'til entropy should catch me up. But I am not without my connections and abilities, and I would always provide for a child of my blood, regardless of my love or loathing for the woman who birthed the babe.~
@595  = ~But 'twas you who began this topic, aye? Surely you had some purpose in mind. Tell me, have you ever thought about having children?~
@596  = ~Whatever I was going to say, I think I've lost it after that conversation.~
@597  = ~I'd like to have kids.~
@598  = ~I was merely curious of your opinion on children.~
@599  = ~I don't think I'll be able to have children. Physically, I mean.~
@600  = ~There's no way I will *ever* have children.~
@601  = ~I loathe the little brats.~
@602  = ~My poor raven is driven to molt after a simple jest? Oh, very well. Let us fly from here!~
@603  = ~Any child of yours would be a sight to see, my friend.~
@604  = ~Would you indeed?~
@605  = ~Perhaps it is too bold for me to say, but I find that very ill news indeed.~
@606  = ~Mayhap your unborn children are grateful for that.~
@607  = ~Indeed?~
@608  = ~Then I can only assume your unborn children would be most grateful to remain unborn.~
@609  = ~I have never been one to fear the possibility of becoming a father. After all, without new life there can be no entropy, no decay, no death. Yet neither am I overeager to breed a bouncing brood of babes.~
@610  = ~I suppose one might say I am pleasantly indifferent to the prospect.~
@611  = ~So, if I became pregnant...~
@612  = ~What if I want to breed a... brood of whatever you said?~
@613  = ~Then we're in agreement on that.~
@614  = ~No. Babies. Ever.~
@615  = ~You think of babies and that makes you think of death?~
@616  = ~My love, I cannot always promise to be at your side regardless of what comes, but I would never willfully abandon you if that is what you fear. I give you my word on that.~
@617  = ~I do not think it necessary for you to look first to me in this. I love you deeply, but yours is a heart that strays, and I know not the depth of your wanderings. Let that be all that is said on the matter.~
@618  = ~Then I swear I will call you a madwoman. And I make no vows beyond that one.~
@619  = ~I do so love it when that happens.~
@620  = ~Hah! There is but one way to assure that, and at least as far as this unfortunate bard is concerned, you have done a fine job of negating that risk.~
@621  = ~Ah, so I should stop performing those fertility rites before we share a bed? Good to know.~
@622  = ~You could likely replace the word 'babies' with any other noun and that statement would still be true, my dear raven.~
@623  = ~I apologize for my stares, dear one. 'Tis only that I haven't the faintest idea how to broach the subject of my thoughts, and I do not wish to offend.~
@624  = ~Haer'Dalis, you know you can ask me anything.~
@625  = ~Yikes. If it makes *you* hesitate, it must be horrible.~
@626  = ~Take your time.~
@627  = ~Just spit it out!~
@628  = ~If you don't have the courage to ask, then you don't deserve to know the answer, bard.~
@629  = ~*Anything*, you say? Oh-ho, you may regret those words, my raven!~
@630  = ~Hah! My clever <CHARNAME>, I assure you it is not as terrible as all that.~
@631  = ~Mmm... I love it when you snarl ultimatums.~
@632  = ~There is a constant curiosity within me that wonders on this Slayer residing within you. My raven, will you help your poor bard understand this inner beast of yours? I know you may hesitate to speak openly of it, but that is precisely why I hesitate to ask.~
@633  = ~What do you want to know?~
@634  = ~Why do you want to know?~
@635  = ~Um, I get mad and my skin bursts open and the Slayer pops out. What's to understand? It isn't exactly subtle.~
@636  = ~I can't believe you're asking me about the *Slayer*!~
@637  = ~No, absolutely not.~
@638  = ~As I said, I am curious. I have known many creatures, usually those possessing some amount of blood from the lower planes, who often described an inner darkness, a monster if you will, living within them, eager to be released from its cage. Yet, for all their talk, I have never seen anything like you and your Slayer in all my years of wandering.~
@639  = ~Maybe that's because I'm not from the lower planes, Haer'Dalis.~
@640  = ~Is that how your demonic blood feels? Like an 'inner darkness?'~
@641  = ~No, I'm absolutely not answering your questions.~
@642  = ~Aye, the blood of a deity is something quite different than the blood of baatezu and tanar'ri, but that was not my point. 'Tis merely that your particular change is one I've never before seen.~
@643  = ~Well, what do you want to know?~
@644  = ~I will be honest. There are moments when my mother's nature becomes my own. Those moments are very rare and do not linger overlong, but they serve to remind me of the experiences that have shaped me into the Doomguard standing here before you.~
@645  = ~Honestly, Haer'Dalis, I can't believe you're asking me about the *Slayer*!~
@646  = ~Tsk, surely there is far more to it than that!~
@647  = ~Ah, this is precisely why I held my tongue before now. Forgive me, dearest raven. I shall retreat.~
@648  = ~Thank you.~
@649  = ~I'm sorry. It's just not something I want to talk about.~
@650  = ~Good.~
@651  = ~You're giving up? Just like that?~
@652  = ~Heh, I was just joking. What do you want to know?~
@653  = ~No need to explain further. Know that I am here to lend an ear should you ever have a need.~
@654  = ~My raven, I may not always have a care for the feelings of others, and I can at times be perhaps a *bit* pushy, but I have no desire whatsoever to urge you to discuss this particular subject if it brings you pain.~
@655  = ~Why are you so good to me?~
@656  = ~Bah, I was only playing coy. Ask what you will.~
@657  = ~Okay, give me your questions. I'll answer what I can.~
@658  = ~Well, if you're giving up so easily, you obviously don't want to know bad enough.~
@659  = ~Because... you are most dear to me, my raven, as I am sure you know.~
@660  = ~Yes. I do.~
@661  = ~Sure. Whatever you say.~
@662  = ~Yes, well. Let us be off then, aye?~
@663  = ~Because I am completely, utterly, and perhaps foolishly in love with you, my dear sweet raven. Bend me to your will, I beg of you!~
@664  = ~Hmm, tempting...~
@665  = ~I do, often. Now, let's get moving.~
@666  = ~If you wish to see it that way, who am I to correct your false perception?~
@667  = ~Truly? Wonderful!~
@668  = ~May I ask why, my hound?~
@669  = ~Because it's none of your concern.~
@670  = ~There's nothing to discuss, Haer'Dalis.~
@671  = ~(sigh) Just ask your questions and be done with it.~
@672  = ~I disagree most vehemently, but I shall not force the issue. As you will, my raven. Off with us then.~
@673  = ~To start, what do you feel when the change comes upon you? Is it painful?~
@674  = ~Yes, very. I can feel the Slayer *tearing* its way out of me.~
@675  = ~Perhaps a little, but it's almost like the pain is... far away? Like it isn't my pain.~
@676  = ~Not when the change happens, but I hurt afterward.~
@677  = ~No, it feels strangely natural.~
@678  = ~Of course not. It's exhilarating!~
@679  = ~I don't think I want to talk about this after all.~
@680  = ~I understand, my raven. 'Tis not an easy thing to discuss. Come, let us move on.~
@681  = ~That must be horrible, my poor <CHARNAME>. Pain often brings life lessons, but the sort you describe turns this sparrow's stomach.~
@682  = ~It *is* horrible. You cannot imagine the agony.~
@683  = ~I'd rather not think about it too much.~
@684  = ~Was there something else you wanted to know?~
@685  = ~But there is a lesson in the pain the Slayer brings me.~
@686  = ~Bah, it's worth the cost to have that power at my disposal.~
@687  = ~Take my hand, dear raven. It brings me no pleasure to see this tormented expression on your face. Mayhap it would be wise to avoid allowing the Slayer control if at all possible, aye?~
@688  = ~'Tis a statement I cannot help but doubt, yet I shall trust to your judgement in this matter.~
@689  = ~Aye? What lesson would that be?~
@690  = ~That I must always control my emotions. Just one slip, that's all it takes, and I will no longer be myself.~
@691  = ~It's taught me to be careful, and that even though I cannot always control everything, that's no excuse to just give in.~
@692  = ~That I should have asked for a different father.~
@693  = ~I've learned that strength requires sacrifice.~
@694  = ~Eh, I don't know. It just sounded like the smart thing to say.~
@695  = ~That seems a rather dramatic view of things, don't you think?~
@696  = ~That seems a wise way to see things. I admire your strength, truly.~
@697  = ~Hah! If only we'd had the chance to pick and choose our parents, aye? How very different this all would be.~
@698  = ~Aye, but who's to say if the price is worth the return? I suppose I shall leave you to judge that for yourself.~
@699  = ~Tsk, and now you've gone and given yourself away.~
@700  = ~How curious! I have heard others describe such experiences as being 'outside' of themselves.~
@701  = ~Yes, that's exactly how it is. Like I'm watching it happen from the outside.~
@702  = ~Something like that, I suppose.~
@703  = ~No, it's not really like that. I think it's more that the pain is dulled by the change.~
@704  = ~That's not what it's like at all. I'm still myself when it happens.~
@705  = ~How strange it must feel to be a passenger inside your own body. I am curious to know the sensation for myself, but I cannot say I envy you the experience.~
@706  = ~How curious.~
@707  = ~Indeed? From the outside looking in, I assure you that it does not appear to this sparrow that you were still yourself in the slightest.~
@708  = ~Ah, so the pain is delayed. Perhaps the change itself dulls sensation?~
@709  = ~It seems that way, yes.~
@710  = ~All I know is I ache all over after I come back to myself.~
@711  = ~Or maybe the change just doesn't hurt.~
@712  = ~It certainly looks painful enough to this sparrow.~
@713  = ~Perhaps not so strange at all, if the Slayer has indeed always been within you. 'Tis a part of you, even should you wish to deny it.~
@714  = ~Yes, that makes sense.~
@715  = ~I'm not so sure. I think it was Irenicus' torments that caused the Slayer to form inside me.~
@716  = ~I'm aware of that, Haer'Dalis. I don't need a reminder.~
@717  = ~Why would I wish to deny it? The Slayer is a magnificent example of the power I now wield!~
@718  = ~Aye, that is an interesting point, my raven. I suppose we shall never know the true answer.~
@719  = ~Indeed, forgive me.~
@720  = ~I have to wonder, do you wield this power, or does it perhaps wield you?~
@721  = ~Do you truly find it thrilling, or is this a false face you wear?~
@722  = ~I don't want to talk about the pain, Haer'Dalis.~
@723  = ~That was sarcasm.~
@724  = ~What would you have me do? Fall weeping to the ground and bemoan my fate?~
@725  = ~The Slayer is an amazing tool that allows me to do things formerly beyond my reach. Of course it's thrilling!~
@726  = ~Don't play the fool with me, bard. You know very well I would sacrifice anything for more power.~
@727  = ~I understand.~
@728  = ~Aye, so I see. You are indeed a master of wit.~
@729  = ~This sparrow would never openly suggest such a thing, but 'twould be a sight more interesting than the one I now see before me, my dull <CHARNAME>.~
@730  = ~Aye, indeed I do, though perhaps I do not know just how deep your hunger runs. I wonder if you will ever be satisfied.~
@731  = ~And what of your mind, my raven? When the Slayer takes you, are your thoughts your own? Are you in control or is it instinct perhaps that guides you?~
@732  = ~The first few times it happened, it was not my will.~
@733  = ~The Slayer has a mind of its own. I'm not myself when the change comes.~
@734  = ~Would it be strange if I said it's a bit of both? That I'm in control and out of control at the same time?~
@735  = ~It doesn't really work that way. The Slayer's will *is* my will. It's not like there are separate urges - 'our' wants are 'my' wants.~
@736  = ~I am *always* in control. Never doubt that.~
@737  = ~You refer to the changes that occurred after your soul was taken from you. Aye, those moments were not yours to control. But is that still true now that your soul is returned to you?~
@738  = ~I wouldn't know. I've never let the Slayer have me by choice.~
@739  = ~I will not risk your wrath and suggest that you should embrace the change just once, for the sake of knowing how far your control extends if for no other reason.~
@740  = ~Then I shall do my utmost to stay out of your path if you should suddenly sprout spikes and claws in the future.~
@741  = ~Strange indeed, and I cannot claim to fully understand your meaning. 'Tis a most curious thing, this duality within you.~
@742  = ~Astounding! My raven, perhaps it is a foolish thing to say, but I would give much to experience such a sensation for myself, if only for the sake of saying I understand you.~
@743  = ~And yet I find myself doing precisely that. Doubting, that is.~
@744  = ~I thank you for indulging this sparrow's questions, <CHARNAME>. Know that whatever you choose to do with this beast of yours in the future, I most sincerely hope you do not lose yourself to the Slayer. You make for far more pleasant conversation than your clawed counterpart.~
@745  = ~Ah, I knew you would not let that incident go without comment. Let me first say that the creature who spoke to me was *not* my sister, just as the one who taunted you was not Gorion.~
@746  = ~And now, with that said, know that I am perfectly fine, my raven. 'Twas but a handful of harsh but hollow words from a vindictive spirit and nothing more.~
@747  = ~You're very calm about this.~
@748  = ~I don't believe you.~
@749  = ~I envy you. I wish I could shut out what Gorion said as easily as you've shut out Saalyn's words.~
@750  = ~Stop hiding your feelings!~
@751  = ~(sigh) If you didn't want to talk about it, you could have just said so.~
@752  = ~Good. You're no use to me if you fall apart over some foolish emotional entanglement.~
@753  = ~Would you rather I fall to my knees right now? I could weep and tear at my hair and gnash my teeth, perhaps?~
@754  = ~Now you're getting defensive.~
@755  = ~Haer'Dalis, I'm just trying to help.~
@756  = ~You misunderstand. I was complimenting you for dealing with it so well.~
@757  = ~On the contrary, I envy you. I wish I could shut out what Gorion said as easily as you've shut out Saalyn's words.~
@758  = ~Not at all. You're no good to me if you fall apart over some foolish emotional entanglement.~
@759  = ~Am I? And here I thought I was being perfectly reasonable.~
@760  = ~Ah. Then I thank you for the compliment.~
@761  = ~Shall we go about business, then?~
@762  = ~And why not?~
@763  = ~Because you're being evasive and defensive.~
@764  = ~I can't shut out Gorion's voice. I keep hearing those things he said... Please, you cannot tell me what Saalyn said doesn't bother you!~
@765  = ~You have a frequent habit of hiding from your feelings.~
@766  = ~Once a liar, always a liar.~
@767  = ~And... I am being painfully ungrateful.~
@768  = ~Then you were a fool to ask me anything at all.~
@769  = ~Again, those... *creatures* were not our loved ones. And...~
@770  = ~(sigh) My raven... I experience the same emotions as anyone else. Those words cut like a dull and notched blade, tearing to ribbons all the walls protecting the darkest fears in my heart. It is a moment that shall haunt me for the rest of my days.~
@771  = ~But I will not - I *refuse* - to let those words rule over me! They were lies meant to harm us, and they did their job well, but lies is all they will ever be.~
@772  = ~I understand. We don't have to discuss this any more if that's what you want.~
@773  = ~That sounds like a wise approach.~
@774  = ~What if you find out someday that they weren't lies at all?~
@775  = ~I wish you would tell me things like this more often. Sometimes it's hard to know if there's any true emotion in you at all.~
@776  = ~This is the excuse you've dredged up to keep from facing your fears?~
@777  = ~Sure. Whatever helps you sleep at night.~
@778  = ~Thank you, my dear <CHARNAME>.~
@779  = ~In my experience, it is the only approach that ensures long-term sanity. That is good enough for this sparrow.~
@780  = ~Then I will mourn.~
@781  = ~Many creatures have paid to see me don a mask and take up the role of a stranger, but none have ever asked me to put them aside and show my true face. My raven, I am not entirely certain that I could do as you wish even if it were my desire.~
@782  = ~What is it you wish to hear? That I fear my carelessness may have cost my sister something of far greater value than her life? Yes! I do! And with that confession, *nothing* changes! There is--~
@783  = ~No. I will not... (sigh) Nothing more will I say on this matter.~
@784  = ~You believe it would be better if I fall apart instead? Should I weep and tear at my hair and gnash my teeth, perhaps?~
@785  = ~Now you're being defensive!~
@786  = ~Never mind. I don't know why I bother.~
@787  = ~Would that truly have silenced you? Somehow I doubt it.~
@788  = ~I was just hoping you could understand. I can't shut out Gorion's voice. I keep hearing those things he said... but it seems like Saalyn's words meant nothing to you.~
@789  = ~There is no danger of that, I assure you.~
@790  = ~If this inquisition is quite finished, I am certain we have better things to do.~
@791  = ~If I am given the opportunity? Certainly.~
@792  = ~I'm glad to hear that.~
@793  = ~What do you mean by 'given the opportunity?'.~
@794  = ~But...?~
@795  = ~I'm sorry for bringing her up again. If you don't want to talk about this...~
@796  = ~And waste your time on someone who is likely dead? Foolish.~
@797  = ~I am at a loss. How many ways could that simple statement be translated? It means exactly what it states.~
@798  = ~No buts. Not a single one.~
@799  = ~Then I would be impatient and snappish, just as I was when last we spoke of my sister. Do not fear, my darling raven. I am willing to speak of these things with you.~
@800  = ~Perhaps, but 'tis likely I will find my death before I find the truth of my sister's fate. Either way, it is not your decision to make.~
@801  = ~Despite my best efforts to purge them from my mind, I have thought much on the words that foul wraith uttered. If I should survive my time with you, and if my path leads me back to Sigil - as it inevitably has in the past - Saalyn's fate shall be my foremost concern.~
@802  = ~If your path takes you there? Why wouldn't you try to find a way there intentionally?~
@803  = ~That's the right thing to do, my love.~
@804  = ~That's the right thing to do, Haer'Dalis.~
@805  = ~After this mess I've found myself in now is sorted out, I'd love to come with you.~
@806  = ~You'd be more likely to survive your time with me if you weren't rushing off in every battle, determined to get yourself killed!~
@807  = ~Well. Good luck with that.~
@808  = ~Sounds like a waste of time. She's probably dead.~
@809  = ~Ah, you have clearly never traveled to my fair Sigil, my dear raven. One does not seek The Cage and have any hope of finding it. No, when you least expect it, there it is to swallow you up and welcome you home. I do admit that I hope to be swallowed sooner rather than later, but hope does not make reality.~
@810  = ~Searching for your sister is the right thing to do, my love.~
@811  = ~Searching for your sister is the right thing to do, Haer'Dalis.~
@812  = ~Strange what a relief it is to hear you say this. I do not often doubt myself, and even in this I am not certain I would call what I feel *doubt*, but your words are soothing to me, my beloved <CHARNAME>.~
@813  = ~I do, of course, hope you will be at my side when I move on from here.~
@814  = ~Of course.~
@815  = ~Hah, you'll not be rid of me so easily, my sparrow!~
@816  = ~We'll see what happens.~
@817  = ~I don't know if I want that, but I understand your desire to find your sister and wish you the best if the day comes when we must part ways.~
@818  = ~Are you kidding? Travel *more*? No, not going to happen.~
@819  = ~And glad I am to hear it! 'Tis always better to travel in fine company, in this sparrow's opinion.~
@820  = ~You are an amazing and wonderful woman, my love. I am grateful beyond words for your kind understanding, though I do not welcome easily the idea of leaving your side.~
@821  = ~Ah. I shall hold out hope that you someday change your mind, but 'tis a sad notion, the idea of being parted from you.~
@822  = ~You are a true and wonderful friend, my raven. I do not often doubt myself, and even in this I am not certain I would call what I feel *doubt*, but your words are soothing to me and I thank you for them.~
@823  = ~Perhaps it is presumptuous of this bard, but I would be most pleased if you and I traveled together even after we have moved on from all this.~
@824  = ~That sounds like a good plan.~
@825  = ~But of course! Who else is going to keep you from getting yourself killed too soon?~
@826  = ~Ah, think you that entropy can be forestalled by your efforts? I would laugh at the idea had I not traveled with you long enough to know that few things are out of your reach. Even the impossible.~
@827  = ~I am a lucky sparrow indeed to have such a fine and understanding companion at my side. I shall miss you greatly if our paths diverge.~
@828  = ~Unfortunate, but I understand. Yours has been a life largely out of your control, and I too would wish to be under my own governance once I was set free.~
@829  = ~Tsk, do not worry for me, my love! Death will catch me up when it is ready for me, and there is nothing that can be done to delay it. And do not pretend that you do not take just as many risks upon yourself, <CHARNAME>. We are both in very real danger of losing each other, are we not? But let us not dwell on such thoughts.~
@830  = ~Death will catch me up when it is ready for me, and there is nothing that can be done to delay it. Still, you will not approve of what I am soon to say, but I do draw great pleasure from knowing you worry so for my safety, my darling raven. It gives me hope, even if it is a fool's hope.~
@831  = ~Thank you, my raven. I sense I will need all the luck I can gather.~
@832  = ~If there is one regret I carry from our ordeal at your father's temple, it is my inconsiderate behavior toward you, my dear. I have not once asked about your feelings upon hearing those vile accusations from the spirit pretending to be your former guardian. For that I am sincerely repentant, and now ask: How fare you, sweet <CHARNAME>?~
@833  = ~Don't worry about me, my sparrow.~
@834  = ~Don't worry about me, Haer'Dalis.~
@835  = ~I'm fine, honestly. It wasn't a pleasant experience, but I've accepted that it happened and moved past it.~
@836  = ~It hurt - it *still* hurts - but I know that wasn't Gorion.~
@837  = ~I don't really know what to feel.~
@838  = ~I feel... violated. That thing was in my mind, taking my insecurities and using them like weapons against me!~
@839  = ~All it did was harden my resolve. I don't need Gorion's approval, or some fool spirit's approval, or anyone's approval! I will do what I must and come out stronger than anyone who dares to judge me ever could be.~
@840  = ~It's nothing I want to discuss.~
@841  = ~You may as well ask me to stop breathing. My love, I do not wish to pry if you've no desire to speak of these things, but how could I claim to have you in my heart if my heart does not break for the pain you feel?~
@842  = ~I cannot help but worry. You are dear to me, my raven, and though I will not pry if you've no desire to speak of these things, I will not turn away when I suspect you are in pain.~
@843  = ~Yours is a wise and patient heart, far stronger than my own. I admire you, my raven, and I am relieved that you seem at peace over these events.~
@844  = ~And yet that does not make it hurt any less, does it?~
@845  = ~No, it doesn't.~
@846  = ~Well, it does a little. I can still tell myself that Gorion wouldn't say those things if he could see me now.~
@847  = ~You feel the same way, don't you?~
@848  = ~I don't want to think about it.~
@849  = ~Actually, knowing that is a big relief to me.~
@850  = ~It is the same for me. Perhaps time will ease our feelings into something less unpleasant. We can hope, aye?~
@851  = ~'Tis a difficult thing, attempting to convince ourselves of something we are not certain we can believe. If you accomplish it, I admit I would be envious of your strength of mind.~
@852  = ~I do. Perhaps time will ease our feelings into something less unpleasant. We can hope, aye?~
@853  = ~Then I am both glad for you and envious of you in turns.~
@854  = ~Why is that?~
@855  = ~I should feel *something*, shouldn't I? But I don't. There's just no emotions attached to it at all.~
@856  = ~I can't let myself linger on it right now, not with everything that's going on.~
@857  = ~If what you say is true, then I worry for you, my raven. Such detachment is dangerous, in this sparrow's estimation.~
@858  = ~Yes, I know exactly what you mean. That is the worst of it for me as well, this sudden doubt that my mind is not as strong as I believed it to be. Emotions and thoughts are fickle and dangerous things. A blade can be turned aside by force or caution, but how are we to deflect attacks upon our fragile souls?~
@859  = ~I've already failed at that more than enough for one lifetime.~
@860  = ~It's worrying, but we can't let ourselves be dragged down by thoughts like that.~
@861  = ~I don't want to think about this anymore.~
@862  = ~We're stronger than that. We can defend ourselves if we put enough effort into it.~
@863  = ~Anyone who even *thinks* about digging around in my head will die! Slowly and painfully!~
@864  = ~Do not linger on sorrow, my raven, but focus on what you have accomplished. Your soul is no longer captive to that thief-mage, and your mind is not a prisoner of Gorion's shade. You have the strength to take back what is yours, and that is a powerful thing indeed.~
@865  = ~Aye, we should press on.~
@866  = ~Perhaps we can. Or perhaps the experiences themselves are what give us strength, if we survive them.~
@867  = ~Let us hope the threat is enough to keep your many enemies at bay, aye? Somehow I doubt it will be so.~
@868  = ~Perhaps you are correct. If we could but remove ourselves from personal attachments, those wraiths might have had no means to attack and harm us. I do not think I could severe myself from the world so thoroughly as you seem to imply, though, and I am not convinced you have achieved such indifference yet either.~
@869  = ~No, I suppose I'm not.~
@870  = ~Perhaps.~
@871  = ~I wish I was...~
@872  = ~You know nothing of me.~
@873  = ~This conversation is over, bard.~
@874  = ~I do not believe that, either.~
@875  = ~I know more of you than you choose to believe, my hound, and on occasion it is obvious that I know you better than you know yourself.~
@876  = ~As you command, my hound.~
@877  = ~Remember that for as long as I draw breath, I am here if you have need of me, my dear <CHARNAME>.~
@878  = ~What do I think of her? I think she is a very poor actress.~
@879  = ~So you think she's lying, too?~
@880  = ~There's definitely something *off* about her.~
@881  = ~Or she's just crazy.~
@882  = ~She's proven trustworthy so far.~
@883  = ~She is conveniently present at some moments and conveniently absent at others. Her overly dramatic tone belies the coldness of her eyes. She is a chameleon and a liar, my raven.~
@884  = ~Indeed, I am certain of it. And I have quite a familiarity with the subject.~
@885  = ~No, no she is *absolutely* a terrible actress. If she is mad, then that would be in addition to the poor performance and not a trade off. She is a chameleon and a liar, my raven.~
@886  = ~Of course she has. What better way to lull a person into false trust than by first establishing *true* trust. I assure you, however you may see her now, she is a chameleon and a liar, my raven.~
@887  = ~But of course that itself could mean many different things. Deceit has a variety of uses, and not all of them are harmful.~
@888  = ~Yes they are! Lies and trickery always cause more problems.~
@889  = ~So... I should trust her?~
@890  = ~I suppose only time will reveal the truth.~
@891  = ~That's true. And it's not as though she's done anything directly to make me suspicious.~
@892  = ~I should confront her the next time I see her, get some real answers from her.~
@893  = ~Oh? Always, is it? I admit, I have never been fond of that word...~
@894  = ~It's appropriate in this case. The Realms would be a better place all around if people were just honest with one another.~
@895  = ~Fine, maybe not *always*, but deception is the cause of many more problems than solutions.~
@896  = ~You don't have to agree with my opinion.~
@897  = ~I don't care what you're fond of.~
@898  = ~I fear my definition of 'better place' does not mirror yours, my dear. 'Twould be a frightfully dull place, this world of honesty you paint in my mind.~
@899  = ~Perhaps, though I must suggest that your assertion is one that can never be proven and therefore rings rather hollow.~
@900  = ~Oh, I have your permission, do I? How fortunate for me.~
@901  = ~So you claim.~
@902  = ~I would not say that, but neither do I think it wise to discard her offhand. Better to have her where you can see her than hidden from sight, aye?~
@903  = ~I don't think she's a danger, so I won't worry about it.~
@904  = ~She disappears so often, I don't think I can truthfully say I have her where I can see her.~
@905  = ~I don't know about that. Maybe it'd be better to be rid of her now.~
@906  = ~Whatever she's up to, she better stay out of my way or suffer the consequences.~
@907  = ~I agree to the wisdom of the latter and shake my head at the naivete of the former. Your words often times leave me wondering how you've managed to survive so long, my raven.~
@908  = ~Aye, that is very true.~
@909  = ~The choice is yours, of course.~
@910  = ~If she were wishing to stay out of your way, she would have done so. Her meddling is inevitable - the purpose of it is what remains a mystery.~
@911  = ~Aye, that is the truth, is it not? Patience is unpleasant when one is waiting upon the possibility of betrayal.~
@912  = ~Only direct acts draw your suspicion, my sweet raven? Come, you are not so foolish as all that.~
@913  = ~If you have the opportunity, I would be most interested to witness your efforts. I admit, I am curious of the woman and would like to know more of her.~
@914  = ~Are you attracted to her?~
@915  = ~You're curious of her? What does that mean?~
@916  = ~I'm curious as well. She's quite a mystery.~
@917  = ~She's just another fool meddling in the affairs of Bhaal's children.~
@918  = ~Indeed. Perhaps I'll give her a little shake the next time we cross paths, see what falls off, hmm?~
@919  = ~Insomuch as I am attracted to any mystery, my raven. Hah, worry not. There is no need for jealousy, for none can compete with you in my eyes.~
@920  = ~What would it matter if I am? Will you judge me for casting my eye at another woman after you have made it clear that you do not restrict yourself to one lover? Surely you would not be so double-minded.~
@921  = ~She is a mystery, my raven, and I long to part the layers of lies and see the fragile truth exposed to my eyes.~
@922  = ~Perhaps, but do not underestimate her or anyone else who crosses your path.~
@923  = ~Ah, well. If she does mean you ill, then it is unlikely the truth will come to light in time for us to do anything about it. Poor though her acting may be, she is clearly a capable woman, if her disappearing-reappearing tricks are any indication.~
@924  = ~Play her game, my raven. Whatever her goal may be, you've likely overcome far worse in your past exploits. This sparrow does not believe this Melissan is any true threat to you.~
@925  = ~Such a dark and dismal query. Why do you ask, my raven?~
@926  = ~I was just thinking about the first time I killed someone.~
@927  = ~We kill so often and so easily. I'm trying to remember what it was like *before* it was easy.~
@928  = ~I'm a Daughter of Murder, remember? It's in my blood.~
@929  = ~Death fascinates me.~
@930  = ~Just idle curiosity.~
@931  = ~Eh, never mind. I don't want to know.~
@932  = ~Aye, as you wish.~
@933  = ~What was it like?~
@934  = ~Horrible. Brutal. Bloody.~
@935  = ~I was terrified.~
@936  = ~I was just happy to be alive when it was over.~
@937  = ~I never really thought about it. It happened so fast, and afterward there really wasn't time to dwell on it.~
@938  = ~It felt good, *very* good... and that made me feel like a monster.~
@939  = ~Very, very satisfying.~
@940  = ~I don't want to talk about it.~
@941  = ~Aye, 'twas not so different for this sparrow.~
@942  = ~A part of me wishes I had known you then, before all the chaos and blood invaded your life.~
@943  = ~Then you are fortunate indeed, in this sparrow's humble opinion, for quick deaths are the simplest ones.~
@944  = ~I can imagine the conflict such feelings must have created in your young and impressionable soul, especially as I suspect this occurred before you discovered the truth of your parentage.~
@945  = ~I would expect nothing less from Murder's Daughter.~
@946  = ~I forget that 'twas not so long ago that you were innocent in the ways of blood and entropy. Alas, 'tis not so for this sparrow. Many, many decades of death and chaos shadow my past.~
@947  = ~Our blood does not define us, dear <CHARNAME>, nor do the lives we take. Still, I will entertain your curiosity.~
@948  = ~Such a cryptic reply you give this curious bard. Very well, raven of death, I shall entertain your curiosity.~
@949  = ~Ah, curiosity is an affliction from which this bard suffers as well. As you wish, my raven.~
@950  = ~I was very young, little more than a boy, when first I did take a life. My father dragged me from bed and took me to his dark dungeon where he bade me torture one of his captives.~
@951  = ~Why?~
@952  = ~Oh, Haer'Dalis! That's horrible!~
@953  = ~What happened?~
@954  = ~Have I told you lately how much I hate your father? It's a pity he's already dead because I'd love to kill him.~
@955  = ~I love your family stories. They make my life seem so normal.~
@956  = ~On second thought, maybe I don't want to hear this.~
@957  = ~I remember little of his reasons. Perhaps he hoped to foster a blood lust in my heart that was not forming on its own. Perhaps he believed that my demonic blood would inspire a natural desire in me to cause harm to those denizens of the Hells. The reasons matter little.~
@958  = ~Ah, my lovely raven, let not his twisted machinations ruffle your feathers. He is dead and gone and naught but an empty ghost in this sparrow's long and winding past. But I thank you for the sentiment all the same.~
@959  = ~Hah! Glad I am that I could bring you this small satisfaction, my dear <CHARNAME>.~
@960  = ~The baatezu he bid me torment was a few years older than I, a half-blood similar to myself but of human and devilish descent. He'd been badly beaten, but his spirit was not yet broken. He spat defiance and mockery at my father unlike anything I had ever before witnessed.~
@961  = ~He was... beautiful. I have never forgotten his face, even after all these years.~
@962  = ~Tell me the whole story.~
@963  = ~Haer'Dalis, you don't have to say anything more if you don't want to.~
@964  = ~If he was so 'beautiful,' why did you kill him?~
@965  = ~I think I've heard enough of this story.~
@966  = ~Fear not, fair friend. This sparrow is e'er fond of tragic tales, even those which spring from true emotions and not pretended ones.~
@967  = ~In the mind of the child I once was, 'twas the only way to save him.~
@968  = ~My father was not a man to get his hands dirty in any direct way. He would torture his subjects through magical means, much like one Jon Irenicus. At that time, I had not been trained in use of the Art and my grasp of the Weave was tenuous at best.~
@969  = ~So, Father handed me a dagger.~
@970  = ~Whilst he restrained our victim, I was instructed in the proper way to dissect and dismember a living body without causing premature death. Instead of acting as he'd commanded, I defied my father for the first time in my short life. I sliced the prisoner's throat.~
@971  = ~You probably spared him a lot of pain and torment by granting him a quick death.~
@972  = ~I'm so sorry you had to go through that.~
@973  = ~What did your father do?~
@974  = ~It actually sounds like your father was trying to teach you valuable information.~
@975  = ~Aye, undoubtedly so, and that is precisely why I did as I did.~
@976  = ~You should not be, for I am not.~
@977  = ~I was beaten senseless for my act of rebellion, but even the bruises and broken bones were not enough to change what had happened.~
@978  = ~Aye, he was. 'Twas no fault of his own that I was unwilling to learn them.~
@979  = ~That man's death resulted in two things that forevermore changed my life. The first was that my father gave up on me. I was yet another failed experiment to him after that point, and though my life was no less difficult, I was no longer subjected to lessons like the one he tried to teach me that night.~
@980  = ~And the other result, the one that is far more important and lasting, was that I caught my first glimpse of the beauty of death. Until that night, I believed as any child would, that death was terrible and frightening. It was as I watched the light fade from the poor berk's eyes that I began to see death as a release, a transition, a doorway.~
@981  = ~His death sowed the seeds of the Doomguard within my soul.~
@982  = ~Thank you for telling me this.~
@983  = ~That's incredibly bizarre. I'll never understand how you can believe that stuff.~
@984  = ~Your philosophy is sick. Death is not something to celebrate!~
@985  = ~So you murdered someone and found enlightenment? How convenient.~
@986  = ~You found strength where others would have been weakened instead. I commend you for that.~
@987  = ~I'm so sorry. Your life has been so horrible and sad, it's no wonder you believe what you do.~
@988  = ~I have not thought on these things in many years, my dear <CHARNAME>, and I have spoken them aloud to no one. Is it strange that I find pleasure in the simple act of sharing them with you? Thank you for hearing this sparrow's tale.~
@989  = ~I would say the same words to anyone who does not believe as I do. 'Tis baffling to this bard that anyone would choose to embrace an existence that is shadowed by the fear of death as one battles against time, unwilling to delight in the inescapable chaos that is life!~
@990  = ~But I do not expect you to understand or believe as I do. I am simply glad that you listen.~
@991  = ~Your righteous indignation suggests that the better alternative would have been to torture the prisoner. If you cannot see the beauty in his death, then I pity you, my hound.~
@992  = ~It was but the first step on a very long and winding road for this bard. Mock me if you wish, but if not for that moment, 'tis quite likely we would never have met.~
@993  = ~I am glad you approve, my fierce raven.~
@994  = ~Do not pity me, my dear, I beg of you. I cannot regret a single moment of my life, no matter how awful, because if even one thing were changed, 'tis possible I would never have met you.~
@995  = ~What do *I* think of him? My raven, clearly we both ought to be more concerned about what *you* think of him.~
@996  = ~Yeah, about that...~
@997  = ~Great, here comes the part where you get jealous and possessive, right?~
@998  = ~Perhaps, but that isn't what I asked you.~
@999  = ~You have denied me your heart, and so I will not play the role of concerned lover as my passions will me to do, but do not think me a fool. I am not blind to the attraction between you and your former sibling. Tell me, my raven, what do you expect will come of such a dalliance?~
@1000 = ~Haer'Dalis, it wouldn't be fair to you if I burden you with my feelings for another man. You deserve better.~
@1001 = ~I think I'm falling for him. Hard.~
@1002 = ~Honestly, I don't have a clue what's going on between Sarevok and myself, and I have no idea where it's going to lead.~
@1003 = ~He's useful. That's all.~
@1004 = ~That's none of your damned business, bard, so stay out of it!~
@1005 = ~My dear, kind as it is for you to concern yourself with the pains of this frail sparrow, I assure you that I would feel far more burdened if kept in the dark.~
@1006 = ~I think I'm falling for Sarevok. Hard.~
@1007 = ~Sarevok is useful. That's all.~
@1008 = ~Look, it's none of your business, so just stay out of it!~
@1009 = ~Because regardless of the sorrow it brings me to know you do not love me as I love you, that love is not diminished by your rebuff. Simply put, I care about your wellbeing, and I want to know you are well.~
@1010 = ~I'm so sorry I brought this up. Let's just get going, okay?~
@1011 = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>.~
@1012 = ~I wonder if yon former villain feels the same for you, my dear. Despite how it might seem, there is much you have in common, and I do not refer to your sire alone. Mayhap something beautiful will spring anew from the ugliness and hatred of your past dealings. This sparrow will watch and see.~
@1013 = ~Ah, then you tread upon dangerous and exciting ground indeed. If I am any judge of the man, I imagine your armored beast feels much the same way when he looks upon you. 'Tis a curious twist, this burgeoning relationship you two share, and this sparrow waits with baited breath to see what, if anything, shall come of it.~
@1014 = ~Aye, but so are a great many things that are far less dangerous. My sword, for example - if I place it upon the ground and turn my back on it, see how it does not rise to strike me down? Indeed, the same cannot be said for vengeful murderers newly arisen from the grave. Be cautious, my dearest hound, for an arrogant fool is quick to lose her head.~
@1015 = ~This sparrow is not the jealous sort, nor have we burdened one another with any sort of lasting promises, but I do love you deeply and have no desire to watch you be swept into the arms of another man. Well, not unless I am invited to the party as well, but methinks Sarevok is not a man who craves such a dalliance.~
@1016 = ~Still, if I cannot have the whole of you, I would at least ask this one thing: Do not try to hide your affections for others from me. 'Tis a disservice to the both of us, and 'twould doom our love to a swift death.~
@1017 = ~Haer'Dalis, I love you. That isn't going to change.~
@1018 = ~How disappointing. I thought you'd be ready to duel him for my hand or something equally as dramatic.~
@1019 = ~You're really okay with this?~
@1020 = ~Thank you for understanding.~
@1021 = ~What I do and who I do it with are none of your business.~
@1022 = ~Perhaps we should put it out of its misery right now, then.~
@1023 = ~Ah, but it will, for change cannot be avoided. Still, I appreciate the sentiment, my beloved raven.~
@1024 = ~If you were any other woman, I very well might. 'Twould be an insult to presume I could lay any claim to you in such a banal manner. Your choices are your own, my love, now and ever more.~
@1025 = ~I did not say that, no. But who is this frail sparrow to make demands of you, my half-goddess of murder and chaos? As I have ever done, I will take what I can get with a smile, for all things fade in the blink of an eye, my love. I am yours until entropy is crowned triumphant.~
@1026 = ~Ah, that is a weighted phrase, and not an entirely accurate one, but 'tis pointless to argue such things at present. I love you, my <CHARNAME>.~
@1027 = ~Aye, 'tis my business. I cannot make you agree with me, oh cruel hound who holds my heart, nor can I force the truth from your lips, but do not offer me love and deny it in the same breath! Even this sparrow is not built to weather such abuse o'erlong!~
@1028 = ~Oh, forgive me, Haer'Dalis! Please, this is just so hard!~
@1029 = ~I'm sorry. Let's just stop talking about this before it gets worse.~
@1030 = ~Bastard! Coward! How can you claim to love me when you won't even fight for me!~
@1031 = ~Enough! This is over, Haer'Dalis. I want nothing more to do with your so called 'love.'~
@1032 = ~(sigh) If you believe it is difficult for you, you ought to try suffering it from this end, my love.~
@1033 = ~As you wish, my raven.~
@1034 = ~If that is what you expect of me, I fear you've chosen the wrong bird. If that is what you wait for, then do us both a kindness and set me free.~
@1035 = ~Aye. Perhaps that is for the best.~
@1036 = ~Believe it or not, my hound, I have my own desires and not all of them revolve around your demands.~
@1037 = ~My love, you brought this subject forward. Do not now expect me to dance to your tune.~
@1038 = ~I find him fascinating, my raven! If only he'd open himself to me more, oh the things I might learn! He is one of the few creatures who has been to places I have never seen.~
@1039 = ~I wonder if he even remembers all of it.~
@1040 = ~I meant what do you think of him as a person.~
@1041 = ~I bet it just makes you crazy not being able to coax information out of him.~
@1042 = ~Do you think I'm being foolish letting him travel with us?~
@1043 = ~I don't want you poking and prodding him, Haer'Dalis. Leave him be.~
@1044 = ~He could be a valuable asset.~
@1045 = ~Oh, he remembers. One need only look into the man's eyes to see that he remembers.~
@1046 = ~He is a dangerous man, <CHARNAME>, but I know I need not remind you of that. 'Tis possible that he will surprise us all and become someone very different from the man he once was, or mayhap he will attempt to rectify the mistakes of his past in an equally murderous way.~
@1047 = ~Overall? I believe he is a far more broken man than he wishes us to know.~
@1048 = ~I do, too. I wish I knew how to help him.~
@1049 = ~Good. After everything he's done, it's the least he deserves.~
@1050 = ~He scares me.~
@1051 = ~If he so much as *thinks* about betraying me, I'll gut him and send him back to the torment he deserves.~
@1052 = ~Sometimes I find myself wondering what I'd have been like if I'd grown up the way he did.~
@1053 = ~His choices led him here, and for good or ill, his choices will lead him onward to an uncertain future.~
@1054 = ~You amaze me, my raven. I know not a single soul who could make such an honest statement of a person who had caused them such misery and pain. I only hope Sarevok does not view your kindness as weakness.~
@1055 = ~It does not surprise me to hear you say such a thing. Mayhap I would feel the same had I suffered at his hands as you have. From this bard's eyes, however, I do not see a man justly punished. I see a mountain of wasted potential and bitterness, and I find no satisfaction at its sight.~
@1056 = ~Glad I am to hear you say this, for it means you have not completely lost your mind. Hold tight to that fear, and do not give in too easily to trust, and mayhap you will survive any treachery Sarevok throws your direction.~
@1057 = ~Hah! Then you'd best sharpen a blade or two, for I am beyond certain that he has thought about betraying you a dozen times at least! And who can blame him, for just as he was your greatest enemy, so too were you *his*. The humiliation of serving the one who murdered him must be overwhelming at times.~
@1058 = ~What a truly intriguing notion. 'Tis likely you'd have become very much like he was before his demise, but who can know for certain? The possibilities are nigh endless! Interesting...~
@1059 = ~Call me foolish, but I do not find that notion terribly reassuring, my raven. A man makes his choices in life, but he does not do so in an empty void. The things you do, the things you say and the way you act, these are influences on all of us, just as we are influences upon you. Sarevok is no different. He is watching, my raven. Show him the path.~
@1060 = ~You have no idea. Given enough time, and under the proper influence, rest assured that I could have him singing his tale from the rooftops, but alas that this life of yours restricts my talents.~
@1061 = ~Oh, look at me not with such disapproval! The picture of discretion and subtlety I may not always be when in your presence, but my talents are exceptional. Should I choose to squeeze Sarevok for information, I would do it gently, my raven.~
@1062 = ~It pains me to see you distraught. But surely these things are not new to you. I must ask, why exactly have these things upset you now?~
@1063 = ~I just want this *over*! I want to put this Bhaal business behind me and move on with my life!~
@1064 = ~I'm tired of being manipulated and controlled! I don't want to be someone's tool anymore!~
@1065 = ~It's tedious and boring. I'm thinking I should throw myself off a cliff to break up the monotony, what do you say?~
@1066 = ~I don't need all this preparation! Just point me toward my goal and let me at it! But no, there have to be *tests*.~
@1067 = ~This is Gorion all over again - holding me back from my destiny, delaying my rise to power. Mark my words, anyone standing in my way will regret it!~
@1068 = ~(sigh) I don't know...~
@1069 = ~A caged life is no life at all, is it? I can most heartily assure you that I understand your frustration.~
@1070 = ~That's exactly what it is - a cage! Bhaal's blood is my prison.~
@1071 = ~I don't know if I'd say I'm caged. I'm just... stuck.~
@1072 = ~Tell me, Haer'Dalis, how do I escape?~
@1073 = ~It can't hold me forever. I *will* be free!~
@1074 = ~Maybe I should just stop struggling. Maybe I should just give up.~
@1075 = ~In the most literal sense, it would be very difficult if not impossible to escape bars made of one's own blood.~
@1076 = ~It's Bhaal's fault that I'm bound! I will not let my dead father control my life!~
@1077 = ~I can't accept that. I won't! There's always a way.~
@1078 = ~I didn't ask for this, Haer'Dalis.~
@1079 = ~Oh, what would you know? You're nothing but a foolish bard who runs away from everything!~
@1080 = ~What if there is nothing you can do to change this path you travel? My raven, I am not one to suggest you submit to your prison, but on occasion one must realize that struggling against our bonds only tightens them further.~
@1081 = ~That's not good enough, Haer'Dalis! I cannot just accept that my life is not mine to control!~
@1082 = ~I hate to admit it, but maybe you have a point.~
@1083 = ~Are you truly suggesting I do nothing?~
@1084 = ~Damn it, I *hate* you!~
@1085 = ~So I should just give up.~
@1086 = ~What else can you do, my fiery <CHARNAME>?~
@1087 = ~I can fight back! I can refuse to do the things asked of me! I can--~
@1088 = ~Who would stop me if I just left? I could walk away and be done with this.~
@1089 = ~Maybe I'll tear that Solar's pretty head from her shoulders. That'd be a nice start.~
@1090 = ~Run away? Hide? For how long, my hound? Would you truly spend all of your life cowering in some hole to avoid these events now laid out before you?~
@1091 = ~Damn you, why can't you just *agree* with me?!~
@1092 = ~You can't know that I'd have to run forever. There has to be somewhere I couldn't be found.~
@1093 = ~Then I'll just kill everyone who tries to get in my way!~
@1094 = ~Is that truly what you want from me?~
@1095 = ~Stop answering a question with a question!~
@1096 = ~Yes, it is!~
@1097 = ~I don't know what I want.~
@1098 = ~No, it isn't.~
@1099 = ~I hate you.~
@1100 = ~My dearest raven, I am trying to help you as best I am able. You have my ear - both of them if that will serve you best! - so put voice to your frustrations and let them run amok. 'Tis far better than holding them inside until they violently burst forth.~
@1101 = ~Thank you, my sparrow.~
@1102 = ~I just want to *scream* sometimes!~
@1103 = ~I need to hit something. Some*one*.~
@1104 = ~I don't need you!~
@1105 = ~Then do so!~
@1106 = ~(scream)~
@1107 = ~(Burst into tears.)~
@1108 = ~But... I can't just... No!~
@1109 = ~Oh, enough of this nonsense.~
@1110 = ~Ha-ha! Oh, what a sight you are! Such beautiful chaos.~
@1111 = ~(The bard sighs and gently gathers you in his arms to let you sob against him.)~
@1112 = ~Here, take your anger out on my arm. Go on!~
@1113 = ~(Hit his arm.)~
@1114 = ~(Hit his face.)~
@1115 = ~I'm not going to hit you!~
@1116 = ~This is foolish.~
@1117 = ~(The agile tiefling deftly avoids your fist.)~
@1118 = ~(Your fist connects soundly with his jaw, sending the bard stumbling backward. His eyes snap to yours, narrowed in genuine anger for a moment before his expression shifts to a cautious neutral.)~
@1119 = ~I should know better than to bait a Bhaalspawn by now, aye?~
@1120 = ~Ah. Then we should hasten to find you a few enemies to pummel, as I've no desire to be battered by those fists of yours myself.~
@1121 = ~Yes, you do.~
@1122 = ~Then perhaps you are correct. Only time will reveal the truth, aye?~
@1123 = ~No, you don't. You are cornered and angry, and I understand this far better than you might assume.~
@1124 = ~I... I know. I'm sorry.~
@1125 = ~I don't want to talk about this anymore.~
@1126 = ~Just leave me be.~
@1127 = ~I don't need your pity!~
@1128 = ~No, I really, truly *hate* you! Smug bastard! Get away from me!~
@1129 = ~There is no need for apologies.~
@1130 = ~Heh. Mayhap I'd best retreat before you sprout claws and disembowel this poor bard.~
@1131 = ~Perhaps you should try and see what comes of it.~
@1132 = ~Maybe I will!~
@1133 = ~I'm just so tired of struggling...~
@1134 = ~Enough of this.~
@1135 = ~What good would that do? Nothing will change.~
@1136 = ~Stop baiting me!~
@1137 = ~I know. I can see it in your eyes.~
@1138 = ~A self-fulfilling prophecy if I've ever heard one.~
@1139 = ~Hah! I beg you forgive me for this even before I say it, but I most sincerely doubt you will damage this Solar of yours in any fashion.~
@1140 = ~I know. I'm just... (sigh)~
@1141 = ~A girl can dream, can't she?~
@1142 = ~You doubt my abilities still? After all we've been through?~
@1143 = ~You have a knack for accomplishing the impossible, this is true, and while I do not doubt your prowess, if you believe a mortal such as yourself could fatally wound a celestial warrior, I will begin to doubt your sanity.~
@1144 = ~I know that, my love, but do any of us really have control over our lives? Is there a way for any of us to be truly free?~
@1145 = ~Death is the only real freedom, isn't it?~
@1146 = ~What a horribly depressing thought.~
@1147 = ~Even that is uncertain, for who can tell you for sure what awaits beyond the grave?~
@1148 = ~No, you did not, my dear friend, but do any of us really have control over our lives? Is there a way for any of us to be truly free?~
@1149 = ~Perhaps I am, but at least I have the freedom to run when I wish. You are naught but a caged kitten with prettily trimmed claws, snarling adorably at everyone who looks upon you!~
@1150 = ~Says the man I found counting grains of rice in the sewers!~
@1151 = ~Oh, you are a *bastard*!~
@1152 = ~Heh... Nice imagery.~
@1153 = ~Watch yourself, bard.~
@1154 = ~So I've been told.~
@1155 = ~Thank you. I thought it rather apropos.~
@1156 = ~This from the woman who let her *soul* be taken!~
@1157 = ~At least I can travel more than a handful of miles before whining about exhaustion!~
@1158 = ~Heh... Not bad.~
@1159 = ~Oh, you are a cruel woman to attack a man's stamina! My poor ego...~
@1160 = ~What is the difference?~
@1161 = ~If one is caged, one needs a specific key to escape. If one is merely *stuck*, there is possibly a far greater range of escape routes.~
@1162 = ~In my case, I don't think there is much of one.~
@1163 = ~You're not being very encouraging.~
@1164 = ~There isn't one. It just sounds less pathetic to say 'stuck.'~
@1165 = ~Wisely put, my raven. But one has to wonder if it the difference means anything in your particular situation.~
@1166 = ~Hah! A fair point indeed.~
@1167 = ~You look to me for answers? Well, I suppose the first step would be to define what exactly it is you seek to free yourself from.~
@1168 = ~I want rid of this taint in me. I want nothing more to do with Bhaal!~
@1169 = ~This destiny or fate or string of really horrible luck is what I'd like to put behind me. None of my choices feel like they're *mine*!~
@1170 = ~I have no idea.~
@1171 = ~If I were free of the restrictions of mortality, I wouldn't have any of these problems.~
@1172 = ~Right now all I wish to be free of is your ceaseless prattle.~
@1173 = ~I do not believe we have the means to accomplish such a thing, my raven. Perhaps in time, but I would not hold to hope.~
@1174 = ~Perhaps you should.~
@1175 = ~If that is your goal, it is no great wonder to this sparrow that you have little satisfaction with your current situation.~
@1176 = ~Hah, good luck with that.~
@1177 = ~Ah, such fire! Cling to that passion, my raven, and you may indeed find freedom.~
@1178 = ~If you truly felt that way, you'd have died long ago.~
@1179 = ~Yes, you're right.~
@1180 = ~Everyone has a breaking point, Haer'Dalis.~
@1181 = ~So you say.~
@1182 = ~Maybe I'm already dead and my body just hasn't caught up to that fact yet.~
@1183 = ~It's just so *hard*.~
@1184 = ~You are stronger than any person I have ever met, my raven, and that is the truth. Do not let self-doubt weaken you.~
@1185 = ~Do you believe yours has been reached?~
@1186 = ~No, I suppose not.~
@1187 = ~It's close, Haer'Dalis. I don't know how much longer I can keep going.~
@1188 = ~I don't know.~
@1189 = ~I'm not dead yet.~
@1190 = ~I just want to lay down and die, Haer'Dalis.~
@1191 = ~No, no! Only *I* am permitted such morbid thoughts.~
@1192 = ~Most things are, I fear.~
@1193 = ~To be used at the whim of another and helpless to put an end to it is one of this sparrow's deepest fears. Were I you, I would rage against my fate as well.~
@1194 = ~Ha-ha! I would be very disappointed if you resorted to such means to liven up your existence. Surely there is another answer to your tedium?~
@1195 = ~The truth is my life is far too exciting for my tastes already.~
@1196 = ~Nope. First cliff I find, I'm jumping.~
@1197 = ~Do you have any suggestions?~
@1198 = ~Well, you could take your clothes off more often...~
@1199 = ~I could take up knitting.~
@1200 = ~I just feel like I should give up. Stop trying.~
@1201 = ~What a disappointing revelation.~
@1202 = ~Ah, I believe it is a very good sign indeed that you can keep your humor so well through all of these events!~
@1203 = ~None that would not make you blush, I fear.~
@1204 = ~Many, but I will not speak of such things without a bit more privacy.~
@1205 = ~This sparrow thinks similar thoughts of you.~
@1206 = ~You lament that there are forces you cannot control holding you back? Aye, I suppose I can well understand how that might be upsetting.~
@1207 = ~You hunger for more, is that it? I admit, this sparrow does not much understand such urges, but I am not the child of a dead god either.~
@1208 = ~This broken look you wear does not suit you in the least. What can I do, what can I *say*? Tell me and it will be done.~
@1209 = ~Thank you, but I'll be okay.~
@1210 = ~Tell me you love me.~
@1211 = ~Hold me.~
@1212 = ~Just keep killing my enemies with me and that will be enough.~
@1213 = ~There's nothing you can do.~
@1214 = ~I have already done so once before and have not revoked the words.~
@1215 = ~You know I do. I love you, my sweet <CHARNAME>.~
@1216 = ~(The bard folds you into his embrace with a soft sigh.)~
@1217 = ~I would gladly hold you until the stars fall from the heavens and the multiverse devours itself. Do not doubt that.~
@1218 = ~Do you feel at all better now, my dear?~
@1219 = ~Yes, thank you. It was good to vent some of those frustrations.~
@1220 = ~This was a nice talk, Haer'Dalis.~
@1221 = ~I love you.~
@1222 = ~Perhaps a little.~
@1223 = ~Not much, but I don't feel worse either.~
@1224 = ~There's still more I'd like to talk about.~
@1225 = ~This was pointless. Let's just go.~
@1226 = ~I'll feel better when your mouth stops moving.~
@1227 = ~I enjoy these talks we have. I am always here if you have need of me, my raven, in whatever capacity you desire.~
@1228 = ~I agree! I am always here if you have need of me, my raven, in whatever capacity you desire.~
@1229 = ~I... Do not torment your loyal bard, my hound. Let us be off.~
@1230 = ~And I you.~
@1231 = ~But of course! Come, take my arm and let us walk a while together.~
@1232 = ~Such an ungrateful hound you are.~
@1233 = ~What a delightful coincidence, for I have just decided to sing a long and lonely tune just for you, my hound!~
@1234 = ~I know not, my raven, but I would not wager you have yet killed your last.~
@1235 = ~Yes, I'm sure you're right about that.~
@1236 = ~That would be too much to hope for, wouldn't it?~
@1237 = ~Only one way to know for certain.~
@1238 = ~I don't understand it, Haer'Dalis. Why must all these people stand in my way?~
@1239 = ~Bah, let them come to their deaths, then.~
@1240 = ~Your dead-god-father was certainly thorough when he set about sowing his seed to all the races of the Realms. This sparrow has to wonder how he found time to manage it all!~
@1241 = ~That's disgusting!~
@1242 = ~I'd rather not think about it, thanks.~
@1243 = ~I have to wonder that, too. One of the benefits of godhood, I assume.~
@1244 = ~He saw his death coming and was wise to prepare accordingly.~
@1245 = ~It shows how afraid he was that he was willing to put so much effort in an act of desperation.~
@1246 = ~Hah! Aye, forgive me.~
@1247 = ~'Tis a perk that comes with a rather high trade-off. The thought of having dozens, perhaps *hundreds* of children is a terrifying one.~
@1248 = ~Perhaps I am too quick to judge, but it does not seem to me that his plans are working out for him.~
@1249 = ~Death will not be denied, my raven.~
@1250 = ~Aye, only by moving onward.~
@1251 = ~Perhaps it is that painted sign you wear upon your back, the one which reads, 'Powerful Godchild, please attack.'~
@1252 = ~It probably says something closer to, 'Attack here to attain wealth, power and fame.'~
@1253 = ~Even if it said, 'Everyone who has ever attacked me is dead,' they'd still keep coming.~
@1254 = ~I hate being a target.~
@1255 = ~There's a *sign* on my back?!~
@1256 = ~Very funny.~
@1257 = ~That would likely only encourage more to come. 'Twould be a wondrous thing to bring down an undefeated champion, aye?~
@1258 = ~But that is what you are, and I see little chance of that changing in the near future.~
@1259 = ~Yes. I'll remove it later so as to save you the trouble of spinning in circles now in your efforts to rid yourself of it.~
@1260 = ~They seem more than willing to do so.~
@1261 = ~It does seem a bit ridiculous how quickly and constantly your siblings stream forth to face you. Surely at least one of them would have some sense of self-preservation.~
@1262 = ~I know! Even the ones I track down myself don't try to flee.~
@1263 = ~I don't think self-preservation was something Bhaal passed on to his children.~
@1264 = ~Maybe that's how it was always supposed to be. One strongest taking down all the rest?~
@1265 = ~It does get tiring dealing with their constant interruptions.~
@1266 = ~How fortunate for me that they don't.~
@1267 = ~Perhaps they realize it is only a matter of time before their end comes for them. Or... I wonder if perhaps there is something in your father's taint that renders them unable to run. Perhaps the urge to stand and fight is too strong.~
@1268 = ~That's how it is for me, so you may be on to something.~
@1269 = ~You could be right.~
@1270 = ~What would you know of it? You're no Bhaalspawn.~
@1271 = ~I don't like assumptions.~
@1272 = ~It's not like that for me, and I'm one of the Children.~
@1273 = ~Indeed? Then that would explain much about both you and those of the same father.~
@1274 = ~It would certainly explain a great many things.~
@1275 = ~No, but I have traveled long and far in the company of one, and seen the demise of several others. My theory is not without evidence, my hound.~
@1276 = ~Nor do I, but this is closer to a theory than an assumption. I have much observational evidence to support the idea, after all.~
@1277 = ~Interesting. Perhaps you are different than the rest, or perhaps my theory is flawed. I suppose it matters little which is true.~
@1278 = ~That is a very astute comment, <CHARNAME>. He did not need you, any of you, to survive for long, so perhaps he went to some lengths to ensure that you would not live to see old age.~
@1279 = ~That makes a fair amount of sense, though I would caution you against believing yourself the strongest. Thus far you have prevailed, but do not blind yourself, my raven.~
@1280 = ~I'm well aware of my own mortality, Haer'Dalis.~
@1281 = ~So far, I think my survival has been just as much luck as skill.~
@1282 = ~Time will tell.~
@1283 = ~I'm the strongest until proven otherwise, and I don't foresee that changing.~
@1284 = ~You are the blind one here if you cannot see how powerful I have become.~
@1285 = ~And you do not need me to remind you of it. I understand.~
@1286 = ~Perhaps, but no amount of either will protect you from the inevitability of decay and death, my raven. Do not forget that.~
@1287 = ~I do hope you prove to be correct.~
@1288 = ~I do see, and I marvel at the creature standing before me! That is why I worry that you will lose sight of your own weaknesses and let pride be your downfall. There is always someone stronger, my dear hound.~
@1289 = ~Oh daughter of the dead god of murder, do you truly tire of killing?~
@1290 = ~I don't kill because I enjoy it, Haer'Dalis. I only do it to survive.~
@1291 = ~Damn you! Bhaal may be my father, but I'm nothing like him!~
@1292 = ~I do tire of it. I've seen a lifetime of death in only a few years.~
@1293 = ~Heh, I'd kill for a change of pace.~
@1294 = ~Oh, no you misunderstand! The killing is fine. I'm just sick of being delayed left and right by sniveling fools.~
@1295 = ~Hah, no I don't suppose I am. I don't expect I ever will be.~
@1296 = ~And by surviving, you've become a master of killing. The two go hand-in-hand, I fear.~
@1297 = ~It seems to this frail sparrow's eyes that you've inherited his temper...~
@1298 = ~True enough.~
@1299 = ~Hah! Oh, your wit does surprise me at times, my wicked raven.~
@1300 = ~I expected as much.~
@1301 = ~It is at that, and for me as well. I am never without entertainment in your fair company.~
@1302 = ~I find myself wondering something. When you kill one of your half-siblings, what do you feel? Is there some meaning to it, or are their deaths no different than any other?~
@1303 = ~I don't kill anyone without feeling *something*, Haer'Dalis.~
@1304 = ~Their deaths are different from other people I kill.~
@1305 = ~Death is death, Haer'Dalis, regardless of who's sent to their grave or who did the sending.~
@1306 = ~It means I have one less fool to deal with. That's all that matters.~
@1307 = ~And what exactly is it you feel, my raven?~
@1308 = ~That depends on the situation.~
@1309 = ~Sadness.~
@1310 = ~Guilt.~
@1311 = ~Pity.~
@1312 = ~Disgust.~
@1313 = ~Rage.~
@1314 = ~Amusement.~
@1315 = ~Satisfaction.~
@1316 = ~Not much of anything, actually.~
@1317 = ~I understand that, but perhaps there is one emotion that rings true more often?~
@1318 = ~I can't generalize that sort of thing.~
@1319 = ~I suppose not, though my curiosity remains sorely unsatisfied. But come, certainly we have better things to do, aye?~
@1320 = ~I hope you do not let such feelings overwhelm you, my dear friend. 'Tis not surprising that you should suffer them in some degree, but they will consume you if you let them.~
@1321 = ~I have pity for nearly all of your enemies, with few exceptions. Many seem to have no idea just how fragile their life is until it has passed beyond their reach.~
@1322 = ~That explains much.~
@1323 = ~I am not surprised, yet it is a bit disturbing to hear you put it so plainly.~
@1324 = ~I know I have delayed our travels needlessly with such trivial questions, but I thank you for indulging my curiosity. Let us be off, my raven.~
@1325 = ~In what way?~
@1326 = ~I feel horrible about killing my half-brothers and half-sisters.~
@1327 = ~It just feels wrong somehow.~
@1328 = ~I pity them.~
@1329 = ~Their weakness disgusts me.~
@1330 = ~I feel a sort of bloodlust come over me when I face other Bhaalspawn.~
@1331 = ~It's empowering.~
@1332 = ~There's something deeply satisfying about butchering my kin.~
@1333 = ~You wouldn't understand.~
@1334 = ~Indeed? How curious.~
@1335 = ~Ah, methinks I've had an influence upon you after all. Come, fair raven, let us travel onward.~
@1336 = ~Interesting. I thank you for the insight, my fierce hound.~
@1337 = ~Indeed? Is something the matter, my raven?~
@1338 = ~No, forget I said anything.~
@1339 = ~I'm sorry, Haer'Dalis, but there will never be anything more than friendship between us.~
@1340 = ~It's over, Haer'Dalis. Whatever we had before, I just don't love you anymore.~
@1341 = ~I'm in love with Anomen.~
@1342 = ~I'm in love with Gavin.~
@1343 = ~I'm in love with Edwin.~
@1344 = ~I'm in love with Kelsey.~
@1345 = ~I'm in love with Tsujatha.~
@1346 = ~I'm in love with Angelo.~
@1347 = ~I'm in love with Solaufein.~
@1348 = ~I'm in love with Kivan.~
@1349 = ~I'm in love with Xan.~
@1350 = ~I'm in love with Keldorn.~
@1351 = ~I'm in love with Aran.~
@1352 = ~I'm in love with Valygar.~
@1353 = ~I'm in love with Lask.~
@1354 = ~I'm in love with Adrian.~
@1355 = ~I'm in love with Arath.~
@1356 = ~I'm in love with Darian.~
@1357 = ~I'm in love with Faren.~
@1358 = ~I'm in love with Neh'taniel.~
@1359 = ~I'm in love with Ajantis.~
@1360 = ~I'm in love with Chloe.~
@1361 = ~I'm in love with Sarah.~
@1362 = ~I'm in love with Sime.~
@1363 = ~I'm in love with Sarevok.~
@1364 = ~I... I understand. 'Twas too much for this frail sparrow to hope you would find love for him growing in your heart. I wish you every happiness the realms have to offer, dear raven.~
@1365 = ~Truly? Entropy has caught us up in her tender clutches so soon? I... understand. I love you, my raven. I wish you every happiness the realms have to offer.~
@1366 = ~I know.~
@1367 = ~(sigh) Why speak these words to me, cruel hound? Do you wish to know if it wounds me to hear you freely speak of loving him when my love for you goes unrequited? Surely this actor need not put on a performance to make the answer obvious!~
@1368 = ~I'm sorry! I don't know why I said anything.~
@1369 = ~You don't understand. I don't *want* to love him!~
@1370 = ~Maybe I want you to be jealous. Maybe I want you to fight for me or do *something* to prove how much I mean to you!~
@1371 = ~Beg me to leave him. Offer me promises. Convince me that you are the better man.~
@1372 = ~Let's just go.~
@1373 = ~Coward. All you do is talk. A real man in your position would eliminate his enemy.~
@1374 = ~I'm telling you because I don't want you to keep pinning over me. You and I will only ever be friends.~
@1375 = ~Nor do I.~
@1376 = ~But you *do* love him!~
@1377 = ~Only because I don't know how to end it!~
@1378 = ~But I love you, too!~
@1379 = ~I don't know what to do. Tell me what I should do.~
@1380 = ~Yes, and that's not going to change!~
@1381 = ~Enough! Let's just go.~
@1382 = ~You are a grown woman and a leader! Do not tell me you are trapped within the walls of a love you helped to build!~
@1383 = ~I...~
@1384 = ~<CHARNAME>, I realize that your mood is unbalanced and you know not what you say, but I beg you not to torment me so.~
@1385 = ~I mean it. I love you, Haer'Dalis.~
@1386 = ~Well, if you think my love is a *torment*, just forget about it then!~
@1387 = ~Oh, gods... You... you're probably right.~
@1388 = ~Uh. Let's just go?~
@1389 = ~I'll torment you however I damned well please!~
@1390 = ~Is it possible? Dare I hope? Come closer and say it once more if it be true...~
@1391 = ~I love you, my sparrow.~
@1392 = ~Why do you ask for more? Is my declaration not good enough for you?~
@1393 = ~No. I shouldn't have said anything.~
@1394 = ~Oops! I lied. I don't really love you.~
@1395 = ~(The tiefling pulls you into his trembling arms and kisses you with passionate relief. When he pulls back, his dark eyes shine brightly.)~
@1396 = ~If <CHARNAME> doth love this sparrow, how can anything in the multiverse be ill? I care not if I must share your love with another as long as moments like this can be stolen along the way.~
@1397 = ~I love you, my raven.~
@1398 = ~Can you blame this bard for being desirous of additional reassurance? Please, my dear, do not leave me in dreadful suspense.~
@1399 = ~I... can't. I shouldn't have said anything.~
@1400 = ~Wait!~
@1401 = ~And now we argue in circles, and I find myself wondering if you have any idea what it is you truly desire.~
@1402 = ~Enough of this! At present, I have suffered all I can stand of your delightful company. You may continue your torture another day if that is your desire.~
@1403 = ~(The bard's dark eyes harden, and for a heartbeat he cocks his head to one side and studies you much like a predator eyeing his prey. Then, in a blink, he strikes.)~
@1404 = ~(His grip on your shoulders is painfully tight, and he nearly knocks you off your feet as he yanks your body forward to collide with his. His face dips toward yours with clear intent, but he pauses briefly, his lips but a hairsbreadth from yours, and allows you to witness the war of desire and desperation playing across his features.)~
@1405 = ~(The kiss that comes is hard, rough, as though he wishes to harm you but is restraining himself as best he can. His touch softens gradually, and the possessiveness fades to tenderness and passion as he cradles you against his chest.)~
@1406 = ~(When he pulls away, your name is a breathless sigh on his lips.)~
@1407 = ~How much proof do you need?~
@1408 = ~None. I love you, Haer'Dalis.~
@1409 = ~More.~
@1410 = ~(Kiss him again.)~
@1411 = ~(Pull reluctantly away from him.)~
@1412 = ~Let me go! Someone might see!~
@1413 = ~(Slap him.)~
@1414 = ~If you value your life, you will let go of me and never do that again!~
@1415 = ~Alas, then I am a morose bird indeed, for that is all I am willing to offer. Too much have I given you with naught but torment in exchange. Set me free if you must, but do not ask me to play the fool for you.~
@1416 = ~(Haer'Dalis seems unable to resist the temptation of your lips, but he breaks the kiss quickly and steps back with a low, unhappy sigh.)~
@1417 = ~Too much have I given you with naught but torment in exchange. Set me free if you must, but do not ask me to play the fool for you.~
@1418 = ~Ah, so this is to be the way of things? You tempt me with hope, but dance just out of reach when I approach? Forgive me, my raven, but I have little taste for this game at present.~
@1419 = ~(The tiefling steps back and pushes you away at the same moment, causing your hand to swipe uselessly through empty air. His expression is dark, almost threatening, but he turns quickly and stalks away without another word.)~
@1420 = ~Hah! My heart suffers your abuses already. What worry ought I have for my flesh?~
@1421 = ~The Daughter of Murder you are indeed, and a skillful manipulator as well. You would certainly fit in well on the Planes, dark hound.~
@1422 = ~Indeed.~
@1423 = ~(sigh) Why speak these words to me, cruel hound? Do you wish to know if it wounds me to hear you freely speak of loving her when my love for you goes unrequited? Surely this actor need not put on a performance to make the answer obvious!~
@1424 = ~You don't understand. I don't *want* to love her!~
@1425 = ~Beg me to leave her. Offer me promises. Convince me that you are the better person.~
@1426 = ~Coward. All you do is talk. A real man in your position would elimiate his enemy.~
@1427 = ~But you *do* love her!~
@1428 = ~Why would you feel the need to tell me this? Do you think me blind, my hound? Anyone with eyes can see I am not your only love. Or mayhap you wish me to throw a jealous fit, is that your game?~
@1429 = ~I just wanted to be honest with you.~
@1430 = ~Aren't you going to tell me that it's either he or you?~
@1431 = ~I wasn't trying to provoke you. I don't know why I said anything.~
@1432 = ~Maybe you should get jealous. Maybe you should fight for me!~
@1433 = ~No, I'm telling you because I'm ending things with you. I don't love you anymore, Haer'Dalis.~
@1434 = ~Ah, so you seek to ease your conscience through confession then? I have no need of such disingenuous words, my hound. Keep your pretend secrets, and I shall grant you the courtesy of doing the same.~
@1435 = ~I was unaware that you needed someone to dictate your choices to you. Considering all I've witnessed in your company, such words seem highly suspect. You will do what you please, regardless of my desires. Do not pretend otherwise.~
@1436 = ~Ah, lovely, powerful, and completely foolish. This act does not suit you, my dear. I fight at your side each and every day, only to be taunted with jibes intended to inspire petty jealousy. 'Tis cruel how you treat me, and so I feel no guilt that I might hurt you when I muse aloud that I have no idea why I love a woman like you.~
@1437 = ~Aren't you going to tell me that it's either she or you?~
