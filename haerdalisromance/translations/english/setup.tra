@5    = ~Haer'Dalis and <CHARNAME>, eager to put the most recent chapter of their lives behind them, soon set off together in search of new adventure. They traveled the Prime side by side, visiting such varied locales as Waterdeep, Neverwinter and Thay. Haer'Dalis made a habit of innocently immersing himself in local troubles, which often resulted in a necessary and swift flight to other, less hostile lands for him and his beloved raven. It is said that Haer'Dalis persuaded <CHARNAME> to pay what was originally to be a brief visit to the Abyss, only to unintentionally end up leading a revolt on several layers of the hells. For a time, Haer'Dalis was the most hunted man among the Planes, a twist in his life's story that he found delightfully ironic after following so long in <CHARNAME>'s infamous shadow. Despite the tenacity of their enemies, the pair eventually made their way to Sigil for a much-needed respite. There, Haer'Dalis searched diligently for his wayward half-sister. Saalyn was found lounging in a filthy tavern, as healthy and whole as she had been years before, working as the personal bodyguard of a respected Anarchist. When told of her brother's encounter with a certain wraith, Saalyn laughed herself to tears. Haer'Dalis mused that it was the happiest he had ever seen her. The tiefling bard and his beloved <CHARNAME> spent the next several years within the City of Doors. The pair disappeared one unremarkable day without so much as a word of farewell, but many tales arose from the farthest reaches of the Planes telling of a smiling, blue-haired Doomguard and the fierce and devoted raven who was never far from his side.~

After many years had passed, Haer'Dalis appeared on <CHARNAME>'s doorstep, ragged and travelworn. He begged the woman he still loved to leave her life behind and come with him back to the Planes. Using the book he had written for her, he reminded <CHARNAME> of all the wondrous places they had seen together. Most tales held that she refused his pleas, and a few of the more cynical versions said she had by then forgotten her love for him completely, but a handful of the most romantic tellers of tales insisted that <CHARNAME> finally gave in and left everything behind to be at the side of her beloved bard.~

@11   = ~Haer'Dalis vanished without a word immediately following <CHARNAME>'s ascension. Scattered rumors hinted that the blue-haired bard remained on the Prime for some years, moving through such varied locales as Waterdeep, Neverwinter and Thay. In any place he settled for more than a handful of days, Haer'Dalis found himself at the forefront of local troubles, stirring up mobs and drawing the attention of local authorities and even the occasional professional assassin. He eventually made his way to the Abyss, where the bard led a violent revolt on several layers of the hells. For a time, he was the most hunted man among the Planes, and those who knew him described him as a man grasping for death with both hands, though such descriptions never failed to make him laugh.

He would never again return to his beloved Sigil.~
